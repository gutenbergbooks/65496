PREFACE
</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>
It has often been urged that a record should be
preserved of some of the first efforts by means of
which the medical profession of our day has been
opened to women.
</p>

<p>
In the belief that a large providential guidance
may often be recognised in the comparatively trivial
incidents of an individual life, this request of many
friends is here complied with.
</p>

<p>
The possession of old journals and of family
correspondence gives accuracy to these details of
past years.

CHAPTER I<br />
<span  class="subhead">
EARLY LIFE IN ENGLAND<br />
1821
</span>
</h2>


<p>
It is a great advantage to have been born one of a
large family group of healthy, active children, surrounded
by wholesome influences.
</p>

<p>
The natural and healthy discipline which children
exercise upon one another, the variety of tastes
and talents, the cheerful companionship, even the
rivalries, misunderstandings, and reconciliations
where free play is given to natural disposition, under
wise but not too rigid oversight, form an excellent
discipline for after-life.
</p>

<p>
Being the third daughter in a family of nine
brothers and sisters, who grew up to adult life
with strong ties of natural affection, I enjoyed this
advantage.
</p>

<p>
My earliest recollections are connected with the
house in Bristol, No. 1 Wilson Street, near Portman
Square, to which the family removed from Counterslip,
where I was born, when I was about three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
years old. My childish remembrances are chiefly
associated with my elder sisters, for being born between
two baby brothers, who both died in infancy,
I naturally followed my sisters’ lead, and was allowed
to be their playmate.
</p>

<p>
Our Wilson Street home had the advantage of
possessing a garden behind it, containing fine trees;
and also a large walled garden opposite to it, with
fruit trees and many flowers and shrubs, which
afforded us endless delight and helped to create an
early love of Nature.
</p>

<p>
I cannot recall the sequel of incidents in this
period of my life, for being so young when we moved
to Wilson Street, the recollections of those early
years are confused; but some things stand out, distinctly
impressed on the memory.
</p>

<p>
My eldest sister had become possessed of a small
telescope, and gazing through one of the garret windows,
we thought we could spy the Duchess of
Beaufort’s woods over the tops of the houses. There
was a parapet running along the front of the house,
and we were seized with a desire for a more extensive
view through the precious telescope than the
garret window afforded, so a petition for liberty to
go on to the roof was sent to papa in our names by
my lively eldest sister. The disappointing answer
soon came:
</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Anna, Bessie, and Polly, Your request is mere folly,</p>
<p>The leads are too high For those who can’t fly.</p>
<p>If I let you go there, I suppose your next prayer</p>
<p>Will be for a hop To the chimney top!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span></p>
</div><!-- stanza -->
<div class="stanza">
<p>So I charge you three misses, Not to show your phizes</p>
<p>On parapet wall, Or chimney so tall,</p>
<p>But to keep on the earth, The place of your birth.</p>
<p>‘Even so,’ says papa. ‘Amen,’ says mama. ‘Be it so,’ says Aunt Bar.</p>
</div><!-- stanza -->
</div><!-- poem -->
</div><!-- poetry-container -->

<p>
The Aunt Barbara here referred to was a maiden
sister of my father’s, a somewhat stern though upright
ruler of our youngest days; but the dear
father, with his warm affection, his sense of fun,
and his talent for rhyming, represented a beneficent
Providence to me from my earliest recollection.
</p>

<p>
Another very vivid remembrance of that first
period of childhood remains. My father was an
active member of the ‘Independent’ body, belonging
to the Rev. Mr. Leifchild’s Bridge Street congregation,
and the May missionary meetings were a great
event to us children, for, taking lunch with us, we
sometimes picnicked in the gallery of the selected
chapel, and divided our time between listening to
thrilling stories of the missionaries and more physical
pleasures. A number of these rather jolly
divines often dined at our house, and the dinner
party of the ministers was one of the incidents of
the May meetings. There was a certain Mr. Burnet
of Cork, who used to keep the table in a roar. To
be allowed to dine and listen at a side-table was indeed
a treat. But on one occasion, my name, alas!
was in the Black Book, for some childish misdemeanour—I
forget what; but the punishment I well
remember. I was sent up to the attics, instead of
being allowed to join the dinner party. Upstairs in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
the dark I leaned over the banisters, watched the
light stream out from the dining-room as the servants
carried the dishes in and out, and listened to the
cheerful buzz of voices and frequent peals of laughter
as the door opened. I felt very miserable, with also
a sense of guilt that I should have been so wicked
as to let my name get into the Black Book, for I
always accepted, without thought of resistance, the
decrees of my superiors. The fact that those in
authority were capable of injustice or stupidity was
a perception of later growth.
</p>

<p>
The impression made by this little incident on a
childish mind was curiously shown on my revisiting
Bristol, after an absence of nearly forty years.
Wishing to see the scene of my early childhood, I
called at the Wilson Street house, and its occupants
kindly allowed me to enter my old home, the home
which I remembered as so large, but which then
looked so small. All was changed. The pleasant
walled-in garden across the street, with its fine fruit
trees, where we played for hours together with a
neighbour’s children, was turned into a carpenter’s
yard. The long garden behind the house, with its
fine trees, and stable opening into a back street, was
built over; but as I stood in the hall and looked up,
I suddenly seemed to see a little childish face peeping
wistfully over the banisters, and the whole scene
of that dining-room paradise, from which the child
was banished, rose vividly before me.
</p>

<p>
But a stranger incident still occurred as I stood
there. The sound of a latch-key was heard in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
hall-door, and a figure, that I at once recognised as
my father’s, in a white flannel suit, seemed to enter
and look smilingly at me. It was only a momentary
mental vision, but it was wonderfully vivid; and
I then remembered what I had utterly forgotten—forgotten
certainly for forty years—that our father
would sometimes remain late at his sugar-house,
and come home in the white flannel suit worn in
the heated rooms of the refinery, letting himself into
the house with a rather peculiar latch-key.
</p>

<p>
Far clearer and more varied recollections are,
however, connected with the house in Nelson Street,
to which we moved in 1824, and whence the family
emigrated to New York in 1832.
</p>

<p>
This comfortable family home, made by throwing
two houses together, with its walled-in courtyard
leading to the sugar refinery and my father’s offices,
was our town residence for eight very happy years.
Here the group of brothers and sisters grew up together,
taking daily walks with our governess into
the lovely environs of the then small town. We
became familiar with St. Vincent’s Rocks and the
Hot Wells, with Clifton Down and Leigh Woods,
which were not built on then. The Suspension
Bridge across the Avon was a thing of the future,
and Cook’s Folly stood far away on the wild Durdham
Down. In another direction, Mother Pugsley’s
field, with its healing spring, leading out of Kingsdown
Parade, was a favourite walk—for passing
down the fine avenue of elms we stood at the great
iron gates of Sir Richard Vaughan’s place, to admire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
the peacocks, and then passed up the lane towards
Redland, where violets grew on the grassy banks
and natural curiosities could be collected. All these
neighbourhoods were delightfully free and open.
Our governess encouraged our natural tastes, and
the children’s pennies were often expended in purchasing
the landscape stones and Bristol diamonds
offered for sale on Clifton Down. In still another
direction, the ‘Brook,’ leading through pleasant
fields to the distant Beaufort woods, had a never-ending
charm. Daily, and often twice a day, the
group of children with their governess wandered to
these pleasant spots. In the summer time Weston-super-Mare
and Clevedon gave endless seaside delights,
and furnished a charming picture-gallery
through all the subsequent wanderings of later
life.
</p>

<p>
During the last years of our Bristol life, a house
at Olveston, about nine miles from town, was rented
as a summer residence. This afforded fresh delight.
Not only was the neighbourhood beautiful, and
interesting with views of the Welsh mountains
seen across the Severn from a high common near
by, and the remains of an old abbey where wolves’
heads were formerly taken as tribute still remained;
but the large, well-stocked garden was separated
from the orchard by a rapid stream, over which two
tiny bridges were thrown.
</p>

<p>
To active, imaginative children this little domain
was a source of never-ending enjoyment, whether
cherishing pet animals, cultivating gardens, or playing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
Robinson Crusoe. When not staying in town
we lived in this pleasant place, my father driving
out from business daily.
</p>

<p>
Only on rare occasions did any of the children go
to school. Governesses and masters at home supplied
the necessary book knowledge; and a passion
for reading grew up, which made the present of a
new book the greatest delight, and our own pocket-money
was chiefly spent in buying books.
</p>

<p>
Whilst the home life was thus rich and satisfying
to children, echoes from the outside world came
vaguely to us. The Bristol Riots took place during
this period, and I remember watching the glare of
incendiary fires from the heights round our country
home. Also I vividly recall the ‘chairing’ of Bright
and Protheroe, with their red and yellow colours,
and the illumination of the house and premises in
Nelson Street, in honour of this Liberal victory.
</p>

<p>
Our interest was early enlisted in the anti-slavery
struggle then vigorously proceeding in England, and
Wilberforce was an heroic name. The children
voluntarily gave up the use of sugar, as a ‘slave
product,’ although it was only in later years, when
living in America, that they threw themselves
ardently into the tremendous fight.
</p>

<p>
My father was an active member of the Independent
body, and strongly opposed to the Established
Church. ‘Rags of Popery’ was a phrase
early learned in a parrot-like way. But a very
strong sense of religion was early implanted. The
Bible was held in affectionate reverence. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
Sherwood’s stories were favourite books; and
although we soon learned to skip the endless disquisitions
on metaphysical dogmas which they contained,
yet goodness, gentleness, and reverence were
inseparably blended with breezy commons, lovely
woods, clear streams, and waterfalls, from reading
those charming story-books. Religion thus became
associated with all that was beautiful in Nature and
lovely in social life.
</p>

<p>
Müller and Craik, the founders of the Plymouth
Brethren, were then beginning their work in Bristol,
and I was much impressed by the earnest eloquence
of the young Scotch evangelist.
</p>


<h3>
EMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES
</h3>

<p>
The first eleven years of life had been passed
under these happy influences of a healthy English
home, when a great change of social surroundings
took place, by my father’s emigration to the United
States with his large and increasing family.
</p>

<p>
<i>Early life in America.</i>—In the month of August
1832, the family party of eight children and seven
adults sailed from Bristol in the merchant ship
‘Cosmo,’ reaching New York in about seven
weeks.
</p>

<p>
The cholera was raging in England when we
left; we found New York comparatively deserted,
from the same cause, when we arrived, and several
steerage passengers died during the voyage; but the
family party remained in good health, and the ocean
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
life furnished delightful experiences to the younger
travellers.
</p>

<p>
The following six years were spent in New York
and its suburb, Jersey City, across the bay.
</p>

<p>
As daily pupil in an excellent school in New
York, entering ardently into the anti-slavery struggle,
attending meetings and societies, the years passed
rapidly away. Our brothers being younger than
the three elder sisters, habits of unconscious independence
amongst the sisters were formed, which
became a matter of course.
</p>

<p>
Often in returning home from some evening
meeting in New York the hourly ferry-boat would
be missed, and we have crossed by the eleven or
twelve o’clock boat, with no sense of risk or experience
of annoyance.
</p>

<p>
We became acquainted with William Lloyd
Garrison and other noble leaders in the long and
arduous anti-slavery struggle. Garrison was a welcome
guest in our home. He was very fond of
children, and would delight them with long repetitions
of Russian poetry.
</p>

<p>
But fierce antagonisms were already aroused by
this bitter struggle; and on one occasion the Rev.
Samuel H. Cox, a well-known Presbyterian clergyman,
and his family, sought refuge at our country
house. This gentleman had stated in the pulpit
that the Lord Jesus belonged to a race with darker
skins than ours. At once the rumour went abroad
that ‘Dr. Cox had called Jesus Christ a nigger,’ and
it was resolved forthwith to lynch him! So he came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
out to our country house on Long Island until the
storm had blown over.
</p>

<p>
<i>Removal to Ohio, 1838.</i>—When I was seventeen
years old my father removed from New York with
his family to Cincinnati, then a small but flourishing
town, on the Ohio River, where a promising
opening for the extension of his business presented
itself.
</p>

<p>
We left New York full of hope and eager anticipation.
We were delighted with the magnificent
scenery of the mountains and rivers as we crossed
Pennsylvania by canal and stage (for it was before
the time of railways), and sailed down the noble
Ohio River, then lined with forests. With eager enjoyment
of new scenes, the prosperous little Western
town was reached. It was picturesquely situated
on a plateau, overlooking the river, and surrounded
by pleasant hills.
</p>

<p>
For a few months we enjoyed the strange incidents
of early Western civilisation, so different from
the older society of the East.
</p>

<p>
Amongst other curious experiences, we attended
a public Fourth of July picnic, held in the neighbouring
woods. At this festival, the well-known ‘Come-outers’<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>—the
Wattles brothers—were the chief
speakers. Augustus, the elder, had established in
the unsettled districts of the West what he called
‘Humanity’s Barn,’ where any human being might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
find a night’s shelter. His younger brother, John,
was a chief speaker on this special occasion, and he
concluded his speech with the following (to us)
astounding sentiment, which was loudly applauded
by the large assembly present—viz.: ‘Priests, Lawyers,
and Doctors, the Trinity of the Devil!’
</p>

<p>
But all these curious experiences were suddenly
checked by a catastrophe which compelled us to
face the stern realities of life, in the strange land to
which we had just removed, without friends or
pecuniary resources. This was the sudden death of
our earthly Providence.
</p>

<p>
The hot, oppressive summer of that Western
climate proved too much for the English constitution
of our father. Within a few months of our arrival
in Cincinnati he died, after a short illness, from
bilious fever, leaving his widow and nine children
entirely unprovided for.
</p>

<p>
This irreparable loss completely altered our lives.
Recovering from the first effects of the stunning
blow, we began to realise our position, and the heavy
responsibilities henceforth devolving on us. The
three elder sisters set zealously to work, and in time
established a day and boarding school for young
ladies; whilst our eldest brother obtained a situation
in the Court House of Cincinnati, under Major
Gano.
</p>

<p>
For the next few years, until the younger children
grew up and were able gradually to share in
the work, we managed to support the family and
maintain a home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
</p>

<p>
During this long struggle our minds rapidly
opened to new views of social and religious duty in
the untrammelled social atmosphere of the West.
</p>

<p>
The wider education of women was a subject
then coming to the front; and we three sisters
threw ourselves with ardour into the public conferences
held in Cincinnati on this subject, actively
supporting our staunch champion Lawyer Johnston,
who ably opposed the reactionary efforts of the Roman
Catholic Archbishop Purcell in his endeavour to
check the liberal tendencies of the age in relation
to women’s education.
</p>

<p>
About this time we had joined the Episcopal
Church, being confirmed by the venerable Bishop
McIlvaine of Ohio. We became members of St.
Paul’s Church, of which the Rev. H. V. Johns was
rector, entering heartily into its social life and
teaching in its Sunday-school. We shared also in
the stirring political contest which took place when
General Harrison defeated Van Buren, the ‘Locofoco’<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
candidate for the presidency. We attended
political conventions and public meetings, and joined
in singing political songs. It was a most exciting
time.
</p>

<p>
Some years later, the New England Transcendental
movement spread to the West. It was the
era of the Brook Farm experiment. We became
acquainted with the very intelligent circle of New
England society settled in Cincinnati, of which the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
Rev. W. H. Channing was the attractive centre.
This gentleman, nephew of Dr. Ellery Channing
of Boston, and father of our present parliamentary
representative of the Kettering Division
of Northamptonshire, was afterwards well known
in Liverpool and in London. He was a man
of rare moral endowments and eloquence as a
speaker. His social influence on a limited circle
was remarkable. Men of thought and active intelligence
gathered round him. Men from New England
who were then intellectual leaders of Cincinnati
thought—such as James Perkins, C. P. Cranch,
William Greene, and Judge Walker—formed a society
of which he was the inspiring centre, a society which
strongly attracted us. The ‘Dial,’ and afterwards the
‘Harbinger,’ with its anticipation of social reorganisation,
were then appearing. The writings of Cousin,
Carlyle, and Fourier were keenly studied, and
Emerson was revolutionising American thought. I
well remember the glowing face with which I found
Mr. Channing reading a book just received. ‘Sit
down,’ he cried, ‘and listen to this!’ and forthwith
he poured forth extracts from Emerson’s essays.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding our close and arduous teaching
occupations, we eagerly shared in the active awakening
of thought that marked the time, and joined
the Church of which Mr. Channing was minister.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1842, our elder brothers entering
into business, the boarding-school was given up, and
I occupied myself with private pupils. Whilst still
engaged in this way I was invited to take charge of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
a girls’ district school, to be established in the town
of Henderson, situated in the western part of Kentucky.
The invitation seemed to promise useful
remunerative work, so it was accepted.
</p>

<p>
The region of Kentucky, where I then went, was
a tobacco-growing district. I there gained my first
practical experience of negro slavery and the crude
civilisation of a Western slave State.
</p>

<p>
This being my first separation from the family, a
constant correspondence was kept up with home.
Some extracts from these letters will give a curious
glimpse of Kentucky rural life fifty years ago.

Henderson: March 5, 1844.
</p>

<p>
No doubt you’ve reproached me for my silence, after
promising to write the second day from my arrival, but
we had a very long trip, and it was not till the morning
of the fourth day that I set my foot in the mud of
Henderson. The ‘Chieftain’ left Cincinnati at two o’clock
Wednesday morning, and in seven hours we made <i>twenty
miles</i>. All seemed lazy on board the boat. The first
night we laid up, on account of the fog; the second we
spent at Louisville, the third at Evansville; we had on
board a quantity of green wood, and stopped continually
to take in fresh supplies. The captain, a fat, red-faced,
good-natured fellow, went to sleep, or took matters very
easily. As we entered the canal at Louisville he was
standing on the hurricane-deck, at the head of the boat,
apparently fast asleep; the helmsman steered immediately
for the rough stone wall of the canal, and with a
tremendous shock smashed in a great deal of the woodwork
in the fore part of the boat. The captain gave one
jump, wrung his hands, spun round, and went to sleep
again. In the morning I went with Mr. S. into Louisville;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
there I got my watch-key mended (a providential piece of
foresight, for ’twould have been impossible here), bought
various little things, and saw also the famed Kentucky
giant, and bade good-bye to Louisville, having been five
hours passing through the canal. One afternoon Mr. S.
was playing on his guitar on the side deck, when a great
rough-looking boy made his appearance, and addressed
me: ‘The ladies sent me to tell you to bring your man
into the cabin, that he may sing for them.’ I translated
for the <i>man’s</i> benefit, and a good hearty laugh we had.
One of Mr. S.’s favourite amusements was to stand on the
hurricane-deck with me and joke about my <i>village</i>; every
two or three dirty-looking shanties that we passed he would
tell me to look out, for he had a presentiment that we
were reaching Henderson. I grew almost nervous as we
were approaching the situation, for really all the little
towns we had passed looked so straggling, dingy, and
uninteresting that it appeared to me almost impossible
for a decent individual to inhabit them; you may imagine
how I felt standing, for the last time, on a bright Saturday
morning, with my last friend and remaining piece of
civilisation, awaiting my destiny. The clerk approached.
‘Madam, we have reached Henderson;’ the boat turns, I
give one glance, three dirty old frame buildings, a steep
bank covered with mud, some negroes and dirty white
people at the foot, and behold all that I could see of my
future home. I looked resolutely down, exclaiming (to
my French friend), ‘Laide, vilain, horrible!’ but the boat
touched and I was hurried off. Upon my inquiring for
Dr. Wilson, a rough-looking man presented his arm,
three negroes seized my trunks, to ‘tote them up,’ the
steamboat shoved off, and I followed my companion—holding
his hand to prevent myself slipping down the
bank. In the middle of the mud I stopped to see the
last of our friend and civilisation; we waved our handkerchiefs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
till the boat was out of sight, and then, gulping
down my tears and giving a few convulsive laughs, we
proceeded on our way through a dirty, little, straggling,
country village; we stopped before a small frame house,
entered a low, shabbily-furnished room, where a poorly-dressed,
sleepy-looking woman was introduced as Mrs.
Wilson. I longed to be shown to my bedroom, for my
head was in a perfect whirl, but I had to sit down and
talk about I know not what. At last I ventured to
request permission to go upstairs; the daughter showed
me up old, crooked, creaking steps, and opened the bedroom
door. How shall I describe it? A little window
looking upon the side of a house not two yards from it,
the rough board walls daubed with old whitewash, the
bed, the furniture, dirty, covered with litter and dust, all
gloomy and wretched. My disposition to cry vanished
at once, tears froze far below zero; I smiled on my companion,
who stood examining me, and asked to have my
trunks carried up. This request brought my hostess,
who with some confusion told me, ‘This was not to be
my home, but that her niece was gone to make some
preparations for my reception and would take me there
in the evening, she being perfectly aware that I could not
live in such a <i>hole</i>.’ The word ‘hole’ revived me; the
inhabitants of Henderson were, then, not perfectly blind;
they had some little consciousness that there were degrees
of decency; there was a small ray of comfort in that
little word ‘hole.’ I descended, and soon found that everything
proceeded with real Kentucky slowness. Begin to
teach on Monday! This was utterly impossible! The idea
seemed to them preposterous, the schoolhouse was hardly
selected, the windows were broken, the floor and walls
filthy, the plaster fallen off, the responsible trustees not
appointed, the scholars unnotified of my arrival; no, ’twas
impossible, I must wait a week; but the idea of spending
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
an unnecessary week in Henderson was insupportable,
so I urged and argued, and persuaded and ran about, till
a man was sent to mend the windows, and another to
clean the floor, and the Responsibles came to visit me,
and promised to collect the scholars, and on Monday I
was to begin. Then, to avoid the necessity of having to sit
and repeat wearisome inanities, I set out, accompanied
by the daughter, to view the so-called <i>city</i>. All looked
dreary on a dull winter day—in fact, Henderson is a very
small, very uninteresting country place, though, it must
be confessed, the view of it from the river is the worst of
all. Towards evening I took a look at my schoolhouse;
nothing was done but mischief. The old negro had flooded
the muddy floor with water and gone away, leaving the
floor like the bed of the Nile; ’twas now too late to get
the place into order. The people are very pious, nothing
could be done Sunday; so, cursing the laziness of a slave
society, I resigned myself to fate, and followed my young
hostess—a tall, graceful, sleepy-eyed girl—to my new
quarters.
</p>

<p>
A substantial, rough brick house opened its enormous
gates to receive me. I entered a small, high-ceilinged
bedroom, where I was to make one of <i>four</i>, and then my
conductress glided away to bring her mother and two
other sisters. The sight of the sisters somewhat consoled
me, because I immediately hoped to be able to teach for
my board. The mother received me with good-nature,
and ever since I’ve been here the whole family have
treated me with kindness to the extent of their knowledge,
one portion of which is never to leave me alone,
and I, who so love a hermit life for a good part of the
day, find myself living in public, and almost losing my
identity. Well, Sunday, and a refreshing Presbyterian
sermon, of an eternity’s duration, I must leave to your
imagination. Monday I ran about, and at last seated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
myself in Dr. Wilson’s parlour, where I received a visit
from one of the Responsibles, a fussy, pompous little
doctor, who talked <i>grandly</i>, whereupon I talked grandlier,
upon which he told me this was an epoch in the history
of Henderson. Then in came the other Responsibles,
when I spoke and they rejoined, and the little doctor
called to order, and after a wonderful quantity of fuss
the schoolhouse was pitched upon, put into something
like order, and on Tuesday morning I took my seat at
the head of fourteen girls, and organised my school.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 20, 1844.</i>—So far as I can learn I give general
satisfaction, but I believe the people are a little afraid of
me, particularly when they see me read German (for I
often forget myself with Hoffman). I am amused to
learn accidentally how I have been talked over in every
direction, and my teeth particularly admired in peculiarly
Kentucky style. ‘Well, I do declare she’s got a clean
mouth, hasn’t she!’—white teeth seeming remarkable
where all use tobacco! All the chief people of the place
have called on me, which plagues me dreadfully, as I
have to return the calls, and find them in the lowest
degree uninteresting, with nothing to do but knit, nothing
to hear but their own petty affairs. Then they are most
unmerciful in the length of visit. If they live in what is
called out of town, nothing will satisfy but giving up the
afternoon, taking tea, and sleeping. The sleeping I have
victoriously fought against, but the rest I have sometimes
been betrayed into, and have sat hour after hour striving
dreadfully to take an interest in the gossip, swallowing
yawns until my eyes watered, and then suddenly awaking
out of a long reverie on all of you to the consciousness
that everybody is sitting in an awkward silence, and that
it is absolutely necessary to say something. The first
evening I so spent I was rejoicing at the prospect of
escape, for the watches had been pulled out, and it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
was declared late (half-past eight), when I was taken
quite by surprise by seeing the Episcopal clergyman who
was present seat himself by the table with a large Bible
before him, wipe his spectacles, and give a preparatory
hem! I gave an inward groan, sat down again and
looked with a long face steadily at the fire, whilst a
north-wester was blowing all the time through a crack of
the door into my ear. As we knelt down, and I looked
round at the funny kneeling figures and up at the walls
of a real log cabin, and on one side at the immense wood
fire, it all seemed so very odd that I almost began to
doubt my own identity.
</p>

<p>
We have had miserable weather for more than a
week. The house, though substantially built of brick,
with a deep verandah all round, is dreadfully cold; the
two immense brick-paved halls, which cross in the centre,
have great doors almost always open. The four rooms
occupying the four corners, in one of which we sleep,
have chimneys, all of which smoke. Then none of the
windows seem to fit, and there are holes in the wall
where the plaster has been knocked off, and will be replaced,
I suppose, next doomsday. ’Tis pretty much the
same in the schoolhouse. There, one very cold day, I
drew my feet on the bar of my chair, then I put on my
worsted gloves, then drew on my blanket shawl; and,
finally, finding a great blowing about my head from
everywhere in general, I put on my hood!...
</p>

<p>
<i>April 4.</i>—The young ladies and gentlemen of Henderson
are most contemptible walkers, opening wide their
eyes at the idea of two or three miles, and telling doleful
tales of blistered feet, wild bulls, and furious dogs, of
which latter there is certainly a larger supply than at
any place I have ever seen. Every negro has his pet
dog, the more savage the better, and all the masters
follow their example.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
</p>


<p>
I had a good fright from some of them yesterday, as I
was returning from school. I’d no sooner crossed the
steps that lead into the lawn than an enormous brindled
fellow, with black, devilish face, sprang furiously towards
me, followed by two others, barking and showing their
horrid jaws. Now, thought I, my time has come! I
hesitated whether I should endeavour to tear their mouths
open, or jump upon them and crush them, should the
worst arrive. I involuntarily thought of A., who has a
horror of dogs, and then called out in my blandest tones,
‘Poor fellows; po-or fellows!’ The voice had the desired
effect, and instead of having to fight Samson-wise, the
gentlemen contented themselves with jumping upon me
and knocking my dinner-tray out of my hand. I am in
general quite a favourite with the canine race, and have
not the slightest fear of them, which the ladies here can
hardly believe, as their life is almost a torment to them
for fear of dogs and cows; indeed, I would always sooner
meet a dozen dogs than one negro, and the only uneasiness
I have in taking my long, solitary walks proceeds
from this; for of all brutes the human brute is the
worst, and I never meet one in a lonely place without
feeling a sudden perspiration.
</p>

<p>
I dislike slavery more and more every day; I suppose
I see it here in its mildest form, and since my residence
here I have heard of no use being made of the whipping-post,
nor any instance of downright cruelty. (It was
really meant as an act of hospitality when they placed a
little negro girl as a screen between me and the fire the
other day!) But to live in the midst of beings degraded
to the utmost in body and mind, drudging on from
earliest morning to latest night, cuffed about by everyone,
scolded at all day long, blamed unjustly, and without
spirit enough to reply, with no consideration in any way
for their feelings, with no hope for the future, smelling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
horribly, and as ugly as Satan—to live in their midst,
utterly unable to help them, is to me dreadful, and what
I would not do long for any consideration. Meanwhile
I treat them civilly, and dispense with their services as
much as possible, for which I believe the poor creatures
despise me. The mistresses pique themselves on the
advantageous situation of their blacks; they positively
think them very well off, and triumphantly compare their
position with that of the poor in England and other
countries. I endeavour, in reply, to slide in a little truth
through the small apertures of their minds, for were I
to come out broadly with my simple, honest opinion I
should shut them up tight, arm all their prejudices, and do
ten times more harm than good. I do long to get hold
of someone to whom I can talk frankly; this constant
smiling and bowing and wearing a mask provokes me
intolerably; it sends me internally to the other extreme,
and I shall soon, I think, rush into the woods, vilify
Henderson, curse the Whigs, and rail at the Orthodox,
whose bells have been going in a fruitless effort at revivals
ever since I have been here. Not, mind, mother,
that I really have such diabolical feelings against the
poor Orthodox in general and particular, but I have an
intense longing to scream, and everyone here speaks in a
whisper.
</p>

<p>
My school, I think I have told you, is limited to twenty-one;
it has been full for some time, and many have been
refused. The girls are a good, pleasant set, much more
gentle than in Cincinnati, and all with faces that seem
familiar to me; in fact, I have hardly seen a face in Henderson
that does not torment me with a likeness to some
former acquaintance. My school hours for the present
are from nine to three. At half-past twelve I ring my
bell, when there is a general rush and devouring. I
uncover the tin knife-box devoted to me, and find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
regularly inside a saucer with three or four little slices
of ham, a roll, a piece of corn bread, a cup of cream, and
a raw egg; the latter I throw into the hot ashes, and
when it has split with a loud report I take it out, and,
peeling off the coating of burnt egg and ashes, am generally
happy enough to find a little clean piece in the
middle, which I swallow, and burn my throat. Then
I put on my hood and gloves, and walk up and down
under a tree in front of the schoolhouse, eating the
remainder, and endeavouring not to think of you all, as I
find it does not assist the digestion.
</p>

<p>
I used to look sentimentally to one corner of the
heavens and fancy I saw you all, when one evening, to
my amazement, I beheld the sun set in that corner, so I
had to turn right round and look in the opposite direction,
anathematising the river for being so stupid as to wind,
and convert the sublime imaginings of a forlorn damsel
into a ridiculous blunder.
</p>

<p>
I have at present four music scholars, and one out-of-school
French, but two go for boarding. I teach ten
hours, three days of the week, and wish the other three
were similarly filled; but it is small remuneration for
such an outlay of breath, and as soon as I have the
opportunity I shall fly off to some other point of the
compass, where at any rate I may learn myself while
teaching others. Carlyle’s name has never even been
distantly echoed here, Emerson is a perfect stranger,
and Channing, I presume, would produce a universal
fainting-fit.

Henderson.
</p>

<p>
I was delighted to receive my box last Sunday, the
12th; the things do admirably, the dresses I like exceedingly,
they are both very pretty.
</p>

<p>
The people here begin to interest me more than they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
did at first; all continue very kind, and I think well
satisfied. When I came here, I did not care one straw
what was thought of my personal appearance, I dressed
entirely from a principle of self-respect; now I sometimes
dress for others, and feel a slight satisfaction if the
glass tells me I shall not scare people. Is not this a good
sign?... Do not imagine I am going to make myself a
whole just at present; the fact is I cannot find my other
half here, but only about a sixth, which would not do.
There are two rather eligible young males here, whose
mothers have for some time been electioneering for
wives; one tall, the other short, with very pretty names,
of good family, and with tolerable fortune, but unfortunately
one seems to me a dolt, the other, well, not
wise, so I keep them at a respectful distance, which you
know I am quite capable of doing.
</p>

<p>
There is a spot called Lovers’ Grove, about three-quarters
of a mile from the town, a sweet place on the
river bank, encircled by trees, with a hill behind, and a
delightful walk by the river-side connecting it with the
‘city.’ This used to be my Sunday afternoon stroll, but
unfortunately it is the favourite resort of the beaux and
belles of Henderson, who, during the summer, after
afternoon church, regularly promenade thither, in groups
of four or five, and meet accidentally on purpose. Here
they stroll about, recline on the grass, watch the steamboats,
flirt a very little (it being Sunday), and carve
one another’s names, and sentimental verses, on the
unfortunate locust trees. I had many offers of an escort
thither and as many beaux as I might desire. I went
once or twice, but at last got dreadfully tired of it, so
while my party was busily engaged round a tree, I
started off on a good brisk walk home, where, some time
after, the others arrived, in some consternation to know
how or why I had so suddenly vanished. I laughed at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
them and their sentimental doings, and they have not
invited me since.
</p>

<p>
I had a very pleasant drive yesterday to make a
bridal call on the Presbyterian minister, who has been
quite polite. The country reminded me in some parts of
our charming Staten Island drives, though the scenery
here will not, of course, compare with that little gem.
</p>

<p>
The people of Henderson were all very friendly
to me personally, and my relations always pleasant
with them; but the injustice of the state of society
made a gradually deepening impression on my mind.
The inhabitants lived in constant fear of an outbreak
among the slaves. Women did not dare to walk in
the pleasant woods and country around the village,
for terror of runaway slaves. Painful social contrasts
constantly forced themselves on my notice. I well
remember sitting with my hostess, who was reclining
in her rocking-chair, on the broad, shaded
verandah, one pleasant Sunday morning, listening to
the distant church bells and the rustling of the locust
trees, when the eldest daughter, a tall, graceful girl,
dressed for Sunday, in fresh and floating summer
drapery, came into the verandah on her way to
church. Just at that moment a shabby, forlorn-looking
negro in dirty rags approached the verandah;
he was one of the slaves working in the tobacco
plantation. His errand was to beg the mistress to
let him have a clean shirt on that Sunday morning.
The contrast of the two figures, the young lady and
the slave, and the sharp reprimand with which his
mistress from her rocking-chair drove the slave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
away, left a profound impression on my mind.
Kind as the people were to me personally, the sense
of justice was continually outraged; and at the end
of the first term of engagement I resigned the
situation.

CHAPTER II
<br />
<span  class="subhead">
EARNING MONEY FOR MEDICAL STUDY
<br />

1845-1847</span>
</h2>


<p>
<i>The idea taking shape.</i>—When I returned from
the Kentucky engagement the family had removed
to the pleasant suburb of Walnut Hills, where the
well-known Lane Theological Seminary, under the
direction of the Beechers and Professor Stowe, was
situated. This healthy place, with its intellectual
resources, became the home for many years. I found
the family sharing a delightful house with the Rev.
Mr. and Mrs. Vail, to whom it belonged, who, with
their charming daughter and the professor and elder
students of the seminary, formed a very intelligent
society.
</p>

<p>
It was during the residence of the family on
Walnut Hills that the noble-hearted woman, Lucy
Stone, became the wife of an elder brother of mine.
</p>

<p>
My brothers were engaged in business, my
sisters variously occupied, the family life was full
and active, and for a while I keenly enjoyed the
return home. But I soon felt the want of a more
engrossing pursuit than the study of music, German,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
and metaphysics, and the ordinary interests that
social life presented.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that the suggestion of studying
medicine was first presented to me, by a lady
friend. This friend finally died of a painful disease,
the delicate nature of which made the methods of
treatment a constant suffering to her. She once
said to me: ‘You are fond of study, have health and
leisure; why not study medicine? If I could have
been treated by a lady doctor, my worst sufferings
would have been spared me.’ But I at once repudiated
the suggestion as an impossible one, saying
that I hated everything connected with the body,
and could not bear the sight of a medical book.
</p>

<p>
This was so true, that I had been always foolishly
ashamed of any form of illness. When attacked
many years before by intermittent fever, I desperately
tried to walk off the deadly chill; and when unable
to do so, shut myself up alone in a dark room till
the stage of fever was over, with a feeling that such
subjection to disease was contemptible. As a school-girl
I had tried to harden the body by sleeping on
the floor at night, and even passing a couple of days
without food, with the foolish notion of thus subduing
one’s physical nature. I had been horrified
also during my schooldays by seeing a bullock’s
eye resting on its cushion of rather bloody fat, by
means of which one of the professors wished to
interest his class in the wonderful structure of the
eye. Physiology, thus taught, became extremely distasteful
to me. My favourite studies were history and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
metaphysics, and the very thought of dwelling on
the physical structure of the body and its various
ailments filled me with disgust.
</p>

<p>
So I resolutely tried for weeks to put the idea
suggested by my friend away; but it constantly
recurred to me.
</p>

<p>
Other circumstances forced upon me the necessity
of devoting myself to some absorbing occupation. I
became impatient of the disturbing influence exercised
by the other sex. I had always been extremely
susceptible to this influence. I never remember the
time from my first adoration, at seven years old, of
a little boy with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls when
I had not suffered more or less from the common
malady—falling in love. But whenever I became
sufficiently intimate with any individual to be able
to realise what a life association might mean, I
shrank from the prospect, disappointed or repelled.
</p>

<p>
I find in my journal of that time the following
sentence, written during an acute attack:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I felt more determined than ever to become a physician,
and thus place a strong barrier between me and all ordinary
marriage. I must have something to engross my
thoughts, some object in life which will fill this vacuum
and prevent this sad wearing away of the heart.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
But the struggle with natural repugnance to the
medical line of life was so strong that I hesitated to
pass the Rubicon, and fought many a severe battle
with myself on the subject.
</p>

<p>
At this time I had not the slightest idea of how
to become a physician, or of the course of study
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
necessary for this purpose. As the idea seemed to
gain force, however, I wrote to and consulted with
several physicians, known to my family, in various
parts of the country, as to the possibility of a lady
becoming a doctor.
</p>

<p>
The answers I received were curiously unanimous.
They all replied to the effect that the idea was a
good one, but that it was impossible to accomplish
it; that there was no way of obtaining such an
education for a woman; that the education required
was long and expensive; that there were innumerable
obstacles in the way of such a course; and that,
in short, the idea, though a valuable one, was impossible
of execution.
</p>

<p>
This verdict, however, no matter from how great
an authority, was rather an encouragement than
otherwise to a young and active person who needed
an absorbing occupation.
</p>

<p>
If an idea, I reasoned, were really a valuable
one, there must be some way of realising it. The
idea of winning a doctor’s degree gradually assumed
the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral
fight possessed immense attraction for me.
</p>

<p>
This moral aspect of the subject was increased
by a circumstance which made a very strong impression
on me. There was at that time a certain
Madame Restell flourishing in New York. This
person was a noted abortionist, and known all over
the country. She was a woman of great ability,
and defended her course in the public papers. She
made a large fortune, drove a fine carriage, had a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
pew in a fashionable church, and though often
arrested, was always bailed out by her patrons.
She was known distinctively as a ‘female physician,’
a term exclusively applied at that time to
those women who carried on her vile occupation.
</p>

<p>
Now, I had always felt a great reverence for
maternity—the mighty creative power which more
than any other human faculty seemed to bring
womanhood nearer the Divine.
</p>

<p>
The first serious essay I ever attempted was
on ‘The Motherhood of the Race, or Spiritual
Maternity’—that great fact of universal love and
service which is the formative principle striving to
express itself in the lower physical manifestations.
</p>

<p>
The gross perversion and destruction of motherhood
by the abortionist filled me with indignation,
and awakened active antagonism. That the honourable
term ‘female physician’ should be exclusively
applied to those women who carried on this shocking
trade seemed to me a horror. It was an utter degradation
of what might and should become a noble
position for women.
</p>

<p>
Being at that time a reader of Swedenborg, and
strongly impressed by his vivid representations of
the unseen world, I finally determined to do what
I could to ‘redeem the hells,’ and especially the
one form of hell thus forced upon my notice.
</p>

<p>
My journals of those days, 1845, are full of the
various difficulties encountered as this determination
took root.
</p>

<p>
I find it written:—
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Doctor Muzzey (a well-known Cincinnati doctor) was
horrified at the idea of a woman’s going to the Parisian
schools, which he visited some years ago; and he declares
that the method of instruction was such that no American
or English lady could stay there six weeks.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Beecher Stowe thought, after conversation with
Professor Stowe, that my idea was impracticable, though
she confessed, after some talk, that if carried out it might
be highly useful. She also spoke of the strong prejudice
which would exist, which I must either crush or be
crushed by. I felt a little disappointed at her judgment
and the hopelessness of all help from Dr. M. I resolved
to write to Dr. Cox (our family physician when we lived
in the East), as a last hope for the present.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sunday, May 4.</i>—I read my letter to Dr. Cox to
Mrs. Vail, who sympathises strongly with my desire.
She stated Dr. Peck’s opinion of the impossibility of a
lady studying in Paris, but asserts that the most thorough
education can be obtained in private. I will not, however,
make up my mind too hastily on so important a
subject.
</p>

<p>
<i>Wednesday, 14th.</i>—I mentioned my plan to Mr.
Perkins. He talked it over a little, and then said with a
bright face: ‘I do wish you would take the matter up, if
you have the courage—and you have courage, I know.’
So invigorating was his judgment, that I felt at the
moment as if I could conquer the world. He offered with
real interest to obtain the opinion of the Boston physicians,
to talk with Dr. Avery, and lent me a book of
Jackson’s Memoirs which gives much information relative
to the French schools.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
But a little later it is written:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I felt cold and gloomy all day; read in Jackson’s
Memoirs, and felt almost disheartened at the immensity of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
the field before me. I hesitate as if I were about to take
the veil, but I am gradually coming up to the resolution.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
Again it is written:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I heard an admirable sermon from Mr. Giles, an
English minister, on Christian worship; very logical, full
of poetry, some of the sentences so perfect that I held my
breath till they were finished. I thought much on my
future course, and turned for aid to that Friend with whom
I am beginning to hold true communion. It cannot be
my fancy, Jesus Christ must be a living Spirit, and have
the power of communicating with us, for one thought
towards Him dispels all evil, and earnest, continued
thought produces peace unspeakable.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 20.</i>—Harry brought me home last evening a
letter from Dr. Cox; my hand trembled as I took it. It
was kind, giving the necessary information, but perfectly
non-committal as to advice. I carried the letter over this
morning to the lady friend who had promised to help me
pecuniarily. I made up my mind fully to undertake the
study if she fulfilled her promise, and already I felt
separated from the rest of womankind; I trembled and
hoped together. But alas for promises and plans; she
offered to lend me 100 dollars—when I am told that I
shall want 3,000 dollars! I did not express my disappointment,
but asked who would be likely to assist further?
She did not know, but thought the plan I had suggested
of teaching, and laying up money for a few years,
decidedly the best.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
Thrown thus entirely on my own resources, I
finally resolved to accept a teacher’s position in a
school in North Carolina, where, whilst accumulating
money for future use, I could also commence
a trial of medical study, for the Rev. John Dickson,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
who was principal of the school, had previously
been a doctor.
</p>

<p>
My old diary of those years, still existent, vividly
portrays the anxiety and painful effort with which
I left the family circle and ordinary social life, and
took the first step in my future medical career. I
felt that I was severing the usual ties of life, and
preparing to act against my strongest natural inclinations.
But a force stronger than myself then
and afterwards seemed to lead me on; a purpose
was before me which I must inevitably seek to
accomplish.
</p>

<p>
My own family showed the warmest sympathy
with my plans. It was before the time of railways;
the roads through Kentucky were little travelled;
several rivers had to be forded, and three lines of
mountains to be crossed. Two of my brothers
determined to drive me to my unknown destination
amongst the mountains of North Carolina. So
the carriage was packed with books and comforts
for the eleven days’ journey, and on June 16, 1845,
with loving good-byes and some tears, in spite of
strong efforts to restrain them, I left home for
Asheville, North Carolina, to begin preparation for
my unknown career.
</p>

<p>
I find interesting details of that long drive, when
every day took me farther and farther away from all
that I loved. We forded more than one rapid river,
and climbed several chains of the Alleghanies in
crossing through Kentucky and Tennessee into North
Carolina. The wonderful view from the Gap of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
Clinch Mountain, looking down upon an ocean of
mountain ridges spread out endlessly below us, and
seen in the fresh light of an early morning, remains
to this day as a wonderful panorama in memory.
</p>

<p>
We at last reached our destination—viz. the
school and parsonage of the Rev. John Dickson
(formerly a physician), where I was to teach music.
The situation of Asheville, entirely surrounded by
the Alleghanies, was a beautiful plateau, through
which the rapid French Broad River ran.
</p>

<p>
I must here note down an experience occurring
at that time, unique in my life, but which is still as
real and vivid to me as when it occurred.
</p>

<p>
I had been kindly welcomed to my strange new
home, but the shadow of parting with the last links
to the old life was upon me. The time of parting
came. My two brothers were to leave on their
return journey early on the following morning.
Very sadly at night we had said farewell. I retired
to my bedroom and gazed from the open window
long and mournfully at the dim mountain outlines
visible in the starlight—mountains which seemed
to shut me away hopelessly from all I cared for.
Doubt and dread of what might be before me
gathered in my mind. I was overwhelmed with
sudden terror of what I was undertaking. In an
agony of mental despair I cried out, ‘Oh God, help
me, support me! Lord Jesus, guide, enlighten
me!’ My very being went out in this yearning
cry for Divine help. Suddenly, overwhelmingly, an
answer came. A glorious presence, as of brilliant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
light, flooded my soul. There was nothing visible
to the physical sense; but a spiritual influence so
joyful, gentle, but powerful, surrounded me that the
despair which had overwhelmed me vanished. All
doubt as to the future, all hesitation as to the rightfulness
of my purpose, left me, and never in after-life
returned. I <i>knew</i> that, however insignificant
my individual effort might be, it was in a right
direction, and in accordance with the great providential
ordering of our race’s progress.
</p>

<p>
This is the most direct personal communication
from the Unseen that I have ever consciously had;
but to me it is a revealed experience of Truth, a
direct vision of the great reality of spiritual existence,
as irresistible as it is incommunicable.
</p>

<p>
During my few months’ stay in this friendly
household I borrowed medical books from the
Doctor’s library, for my purpose of becoming a physician
was known and approved of.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion a fellow-teacher laughingly came
to me with a dead cockchafer, which had been
smothered between her pocket-handkerchiefs, and
offered it to me as a first subject for dissection. I
accepted the offer, placed the insect in a shell, held
it with a hair-pin, and then tried with my mother-of-pearl-handled
penknife to cut it open. But the
effort to do this was so repugnant that it was some
time before I could compel myself to make the
necessary incision, which revealed only a little
yellowish dust inside. The battle then fought, however,
was a useful one. In my later anatomical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
studies I never had so serious a repugnance to contend
with.
</p>

<p>
The winter passed pleasantly away in beautiful
Asheville. I was in friendly relations with all around
me. In my leisure time I studied in the pleasant
grove which connected the school with the church,
rejoicing in the ever-changing mountain outline
visible through the trees. The ‘Harbinger,’ with its
bright visions of associated life, came regularly to
me, and nurtured that faith in co-operation as the
necessary future of society which has become one
of my articles of faith, my chief regret at this
time being the stoppage of my attempt to teach
coloured children to read, as this was forbidden by
the laws of North Carolina!
</p>

<p>
The following letters describe the life in North
Carolina:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
Asheville: June 29, 1845.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear M.</span>,—My first impressions of Asheville are decidedly
pleasant. I find the Rev. Mr. D. a well-educated,
intelligent man, beloved by all, and regarded quite as a
father by all his pupils. He reminds me continually of
Mr. L. in the shortness of his legs and the activity of
mind and body, in superficiality of thought, and obliging
social disposition. Mrs. D. is decidedly lovable, quite a
little lady, ever cheerful, kind, and intelligent, performing
her numerous duties like a small, true Christian....
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
Asheville: 1845.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear H.</span>,—I am very glad to find that you have the
feelings of a gentleman, that though you would not promise
to write to me, you perform, which is decidedly the
better of the two. Now I have to call you and S. to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
account for your breach of promise. What is the reason
you did not come to my window, as you agreed to do, the
morning you left Asheville? I got up before four o’clock
and waited and watched, at last grew angry, and wished
in revenge that you might have fine weather and plenty
of ripe blackberries the whole way! It was a very shabby
trick, and if you do not render a satisfactory explanation
I shall—scold you well when next we meet.
</p>

<p>
Your domestic items all interest me. How do you like
the change of teachers in the school, and who will superintend
your room? Will Dr. Ray still teach? You must
tell me also what day school begins, that I may think of
you and Billy sitting with grave faces behind the little
wooden desks, rivalling one another in intense application.
</p>

<p>
Did you take home any stones for our cabinets? Does
the collecting fit continue, or has it vanished with the
departure of Mr. Hildreth? I have not obtained many
specimens as yet; little Sarah Dickson takes great
interest in bringing me what she considers pretty rocks,
and putting them on a newspaper on my window seat. I
was really surprised the other day to see how pretty they
looked, though, of course, not of much value—little bits of
quartz, white, grey, brown, pink; a stone full of mica,
which looks like a piece of lead ore; a conglomerate of
gneiss quartz tinged with some metallic substances, and
with garnets embedded in some of the stones; and flints
of various colours; nothing to a professed mineralogist,
but pleasing to me.
</p>

<p>
Last week I went to a party at Mrs. P.’s. She has
a separate establishment from the hotel, with which she
does not choose to have anything to do. I was invited to
meet some Charleston ladies who had called on me, and
made themselves very agreeable. I suppose you would
have been most pleased with the eatables (the ice-cream,
whips, jelly, and cakes were delicious), but what delighted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
me was a little Channing glorification (M. will understand
what I mean) that Mrs. Carr (the lady who so
resembles Ellen Channing) and I held in the garden.
She has never seen our Mr. Channing, but the Doctor
used to visit at their house, and she described with enthusiasm
a splendid sermon that she heard him deliver
in Philadelphia. I replied by describing the eloquence of
our Mr. C. Then she expatiated on the kindness and
loveliness of the Doctor’s character, to which I added a
description of the goodness, purity, and the angelicalness
of his nephew; whereupon she expressed a great desire
to see him, and I said that I should consider it one of the
greatest of blessings to have enjoyed the social intercourse
of the good Doctor. The conversation was quite
a treat to me—a sort of safety-valve to heterodox steam
that I lacked so deplorably at Henderson.
</p>

<p>
My playing seemed to give satisfaction; the piano is a
beautiful one, like ours on a more brilliant scale, and as
there was no one to rival me in the instrumental way I
raised the top, played the ‘Pot Pourri,’ and made a tremendous
noise. (I do wish that minister would stop
singing his nasal hymn-tunes just underneath me; he has
been at it all day, and it quite puts me out.)
</p>

<p>
I also showed some tricks which puzzled the company—particularly
a very tall man, with long, projecting nose
and retreating forehead, who looked like a stupid fox.
Miss Jane P. was seated in a corner, behind a little
table, on which were draughts arranged as the nuns of
the Lady Abbess, she challenging everybody to introduce
the four cavaliers unknown to the blind mistress. Everybody
said it was not possible, and Miss Jane turned
triumphantly to me to know if I could do it. I said I
could not only introduce the four knights, but their
four squires also, and then suffer knights, squires, and
four nuns to elope, without the blind Abbess having the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
slightest suspicion of the defection. Everybody thought
it impossible, but when I actually performed the feat
they looked upon me as half a conjuror—particularly the
stranger fox—and Mrs. Dickson thought it was hardly
safe that I should occupy the front bedroom in a young
ladies’ boarding-school. I also amused them with the
three jealous couples crossing the stream; we were all
very merry, and I did more talking than I have accomplished
in the same space of time for many a day. On
our return home, the young gentleman who accompanied
me said that if he had only known I was coming he
would have gone from New York to Cincinnati, to escort
me to Asheville (I did not tell him how very glad I was
he did not know it); and on my expressing a wish to visit
Mount Pisgah, he assured me that to the very next party
that was made up he would be sure to see that I received
an invitation. (I did not say he need not trouble himself,
that I should get the invitation without his interference;
I only thought all that, for I am growing very polite in
my <i>manners</i>.)
</p>

<p>
... About a week ago I rode to the Sulphur Springs,
which are about four miles from Asheville; they are not
much resorted to, the country round being tangled and
rather uninteresting. The springs, however, are situated
in a delightful valley, through which the wind blew most
refreshingly; a roofed platform is erected in the midst of
the grass plat, the perfectly clear water welling up into a
marble basin on one side, and then flowing away in a
little rivulet. I found a country woman resting herself
on the platform, with a bright, pleasant face and very
communicative. I sat and talked to her and thought of
the woman of Samaria; presently a bilious-looking
Southerner came down and drank a dipper full of water,
which dispelled all the illusion, for my imagination conjured
up rice-swamps and clanking chains.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I have not taken many walks about here, for the
weather, though delightful for July, is too hot for walking,
and riding seems out of the question, it being harder to
get a horse here even than it was at Henderson. Dr.
Dickson has one old fellow, but he is used in the fields a
good deal, and one person cannot ride alone. Borrowing
or hiring seems equally impossible, so I shall be the poorest
rider in the family apparently, for I suppose Henry’s
‘nice little pony,’ and our three (?) other horses, will be
kept in constant use.
</p>

<p>
I find it equally impossible to get a partner in chess;
Dr. Dickson understands no such games, and disapproves
of them, so I cannot train any of the girls, and Miss
C. does not care to play. I set up the men one afternoon
and tried to beat myself; but it would not do, I
could get up no enthusiasm, so I put the pieces away in
despair, and used the board as a writing-desk.
</p>

<p>
Tell me all the home news: what M. does and
Ellen and Kate, what nonsense H. talks and S.’s
puns, the visits they receive and the excursions they
make.
</p>

<p>
If you hear of any new books let me know, for I
imagine they do not find their way up here very quickly.
I have Littel’s ‘Living Age’ regularly, and I am reading
Alison’s ‘History of Europe;’ but such a thing as a
novel Dr. Dickson reprobates, and all he calls light
reading.
</p>

<p>
Now, Howy, do you not think I am very good to
send you such a long letter for your little scrap? Write
me a full sheet soon.

Asheville: July 27, 1845.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,—I received your welcome letter last
night while engaged in your favourite Saturday evening’s
employment—singing hymns. A stranger minister who
was to preach next day had just arrived, and I, seated at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
the piano, surrounded by the girls, was supplying him
with sacred entertainment, when Howard Dickson laid
your letter beside me. I smiled, and gave an involuntary
quaver in the ‘Come, Holy Spi—,’ which made the girls
giggle; but seeing the four eyes of the two ministers
bent astonishedly upon us, I pulled a long face, the girls
straightened theirs, and we continued—‘rit, heavenly
Dove.’
</p>

<p>
I soon ran off with a candle and my letter, and read
with eagerness all the profane parts, and most of the
religious, as it is a first letter. I am very glad that you
derive so much peaceful satisfaction from Upham. I
know it has a soothing influence, for whenever I had to
go into your room of an afternoon I found you asleep on
the bed with the book in your hand; but I find no lack
of such books here—Jonathan Edwards on the Affections,
which I have lately read, has the same peaceful
tendency.
</p>

<p>
I have just performed my first professional cure, and
am already dubbed Dr. Blackwell by the household. I
mesmerised away a severe headache that afflicted Miss
O’Heara, a kind-hearted, child-like, black-haired little old
maid, the favourite of the family and especial pet of the
children. She had just recovered from a very severe
attack of illness, and great suffering in the mouth from
calomel, which made her declare that no physician ought
to receive his diploma till he has been salivated, that he
may know the torture he is inflicting on his patients. I
went into her room last night, and found her suffering
from an intense throbbing headache. I offered to relieve
her, half doubting my own powers, never having attempted
anything of the kind; but in a quarter or half
an hour she was entirely relieved, and declared some
good angel had sent me to her aid.
</p>

<p>
I have just returned from the Sunday-school which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
we have organised to-day for the slaves. When I first
came here I determined to teach all the slaves I could to
read and write, and elevate them in every way in my
power, as the only way I could reconcile it to my conscience
to live amongst them; but to my consternation
I found that the laws forbade it, and that Dr. Dickson
was not willing to evade them. Not the slightest effort
was made to instruct them in any way, except that now
and then a sermon was preached to them; but they had
to labour on without a ray of light or hope. It was intolerable
to me, and I proposed at last we should have
Sunday-school, and give them real instruction; and as
such a scheme had been talked of about a year ago, I
found a few who were willing to engage in the undertaking.
Accordingly, this afternoon at three o’clock we
made a beginning—four ladies and one gentleman, with
about twenty-five scholars; we have a class of men,
women, boys, and two of girls. I take one of the latter,
four girls, from eight to twelve years old. I assure you
I felt a little odd, sitting down before those degraded little
beings, to teach them a religion which the owners professed
to follow whilst violating its very first principles,
and audaciously presuming to stand between them and
the Almighty. As I looked round the little room and
saw those ladies holding forth to their slaves, fancying
that now they were fulfilling every duty and were quite
model mistresses, I longed to jump up, and, taking the
chains from those injured, unmanned men, fasten them
on their tyrants till they learned in dismal wretchedness
the bitterness of that bondage they inflict on their
brethren. But one person can do nothing. I sat quietly
teaching, and reserved my indignation to vent on this
inoffensive white paper. I am afraid much cannot be
done for the slaves in this way; their minds are so obscured,
and oral instruction is so tedious, that the patience
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
of both teachers and scholars may be worn out. I, however,
shall do my utmost to illuminate both head and
heart, and the poor children thanked me with humble
sincerity this afternoon for my efforts.
</p>

<p>
You need not be afraid I shall make myself conspicuous,
or gain the hated name of Abolitionist. I
sometimes reproach myself for my prudence and the
calmness with which I answer some outrageous injustice,
while I am really raging with indignation; but it is the
only way in which I can hope to do any good, for the
slightest display of feeling arms all their prejudices, and
I am no orator to convert by a burst of passionate eloquence;
so I must even go on in my own quiet manner,
knowing that it does not proceed from cowardice.
</p>

<p>
I wish I could give you a cheering account of numerous
music scholars and French and German classes, but
the place is too small for anything of the sort. I hear
constantly a great deal about Charleston; everybody
seems connected with that city, and a great many of the
inhabitants are spending the summer here and at the
Springs. I mean to make some inquiries about the
schools and teachers of that city; it would be a pleasant
residence in some respects. I mention this, not from
any serious idea of going there, but that you may know
the schemes that are passing through my mind. I am
fixed here till December.
</p>

<p>
My brain is as busy as can be, and consequently I am
happy; for one is only miserable when stupid and lazy,
wasting the time and doing no good to self or anybody
else.
</p>

<p>
So you, too, mother, confirm Henry’s account of the
‘fine doings’ on our quiet Walnut Hills. I shall really
begin to think that I have been the evil genius of the
place, withholding the rain from the garden, the visitors
from the house; for no sooner am I gone than floods of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
both flow down and up, and everywhere are greenness
and gaiety. Very well; I certainly won’t come back
to bring a blight into Paradise.... But, seriously, if
Miss A. G. comes up, I hope M. will consider it a call
and return it with dignity, for it seems to me H. is
growing wild and turning our house into a sort of
banqueting-hall for Comus and his crew, which I
beg M. to set her face against by taking every visit to
herself....
</p>

<p>
My white bonnet is much admired here. Miss Charlotte
Carr sent to borrow it the other day, and has made
one its exact image, flowers and all. I felt quite proud in
setting the fashion in Asheville!

<p>
In 1846 the Asheville school was broken up, and
I resolved to try my fortunes in the South, journeying
with Mrs. John Dickson to Charleston, S.C.,
exchanging the fine mountain country for the level
rice-fields of South Carolina. It was a striking
journey—a transformation scene! It is thus described
in a journal of that date:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
On January 14 we left by stage early in the morning.
We jolted off in the bright moonlight; the ground was
frozen hard and very rough. I walked with Flinn over
the Blue Ridge and the Saluda, another branch of the
Alleghanies. The weather was beautiful, the air invigorating,
and the mountain seemed to deserve its name.
On the top of the Saluda a stone marks the boundary of
the two Carolinas. I hesitated at crossing it, for my
affections are all with the ‘old North State.’ At the foot
we drank to its health from the Poinsett Spring, as we
had promised John to do. A little afterwards we passed
the wildest scenery I ever remember to have seen. The
road wound down the south side of the mountain in very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
abrupt curves, so as to form a succession of terraces one
above the other; whilst, on the opposite side, the wooded
mountain ridge, though so near, was softened by mist,
and seemed to tower to tremendous heights, though I
was surprised to see how this height seemed to lessen as
we descended. We reached Greenville late, after eighty
miles of horribly rough staging; there we spent the next
day, and I took a pleasant walk with Flinn by the reedy
river, which rushes in cascades through rocks and wooded
hills. The next two days we travelled through pretty,
undulating country, gradually becoming more level. I
saw the first characteristic swamp, also the palmetto and
the strange grey moss, a yard long, hanging from the
trees. We spent a night in Columbia. It seemed a
strange revival of old associations to enter a city once
more. The hotel was full of horse-racers engaged in
betting. The next day a rapid railway journey brought
us to Charleston by two o’clock. The country between
Columbia and Charleston was much prettier than I
expected. The lovely day made everything beautiful;
the numerous pines, the holly, wild orange, live oak, and
other evergreens seemed to give the lie to January.
The moss, hanging one or two yards long from the trees,
looked like gigantic webs or the ghosts of weeping
willows; the rice-fields, under water, were as blue as the
sky; the level cotton-fields, extending for hundreds of
acres, with their belts of evergreens, were strange and
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
When we reached Charleston we were met at the
station by Dr. Sam. Dickson’s carriage, with its very
gentlemanly negro coachman, who had been sent for
Flinn and ‘the lady.’ So I said good-bye to kind Mrs.
John Dickson, and, driving softly along to a large old-fashioned
house, surrounded by a garden full of tall
evergreens, I entered a spacious hall and was welcomed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
by Dr. Sam. and Mrs. Dickson and their eldest daughter,
and ushered into a handsome drawing-room, cloak, hood,
smoke, and all.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
Dr. Samuel H. Dickson, who thus hospitably
welcomed me, was a distinguished physician of
Charleston and professor in the Medical College of
that town. He gave me kind encouragement in
relation to my medical studies. Through his influence
I soon obtained a position as teacher of
music in the fashionable boarding-school of Mrs.
Du Pré (a connection of the Doctor), where I taught
for some hours every day, spending all my spare
time in pursuing the medical studies which Dr.
Dickson directed. Every morning a couple of hours
were devoted before breakfast to learning the necessary
rudiments of Greek (for I had only so far
been acquainted with Latin).
</p>

<p>
The boarding-school occupied a fine old-fashioned
mansion. The noble drawing-room, with its numerous
windows overlooking the bay, was the scene of
my teaching duties.
</p>

<p>
When they were over, many quiet hours were
passed in that pleasant room, studying the medical
books which the Doctor supplied from his library.
</p>

<p>
The severe duties of teaching and study were
occasionally varied by larger interests, such as
hearing a very able (though erroneous) oration on
States’ Rights, by Calhoun; or the more carnal
pleasure of a visit to a banana plantation.
</p>

<p>
John C. Calhoun’s address, given to the enthusiastic
meeting which crowded the theatre, was noteworthy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
The contrast between the calm, able orator,
who appeared entirely unmoved by the rapturous
demonstrations of his audience, who responded to
every point in his clever but measured oratory,
resembled the effect produced in our later day by
the able statesman Parnell, who dominated his
ardent Irish followers by a similarly contrasted
mental constitution. The influence of this able
statesman, John C. Calhoun, was largely instrumental
in causing the Civil War in America.

The following familiar home letters indicate some
of the varieties in the Charleston life:—

Charleston: January 30, 1847.
</p>

<p>
Now, dear M., for a comfortable Sunday afternoon
chat with you, after a long—it seems to me a very long—silence.
I’ve just replenished my body with a comfortable
portion of our regular Sunday dinner—viz. ham,
fowl, sweet potatoes, and macaroni—of which last I’ve
grown particularly fond, and now, wrapped in my blanket-shawl,
I sit with my feet on the fender, over the embers
of the parlour fire, and, as the girls are at church and
only good Miss B. in the room, I hope for a nice long
quiet time. But I must tell you of a great musical treat
I’ve had, really the highest pleasure in that way that I
ever remember; no less than two concerts by Herz and
Sivori. I never have been so affected by music before;
yet the first concert made me sad, homesick, and discontented.
I felt as I do after reading a powerful novel
of Bulwer’s. It was Sivori’s violin that produced so
strange an effect. Herz was a smooth, brilliant pianoforte
player, with considerable superficial talent, nothing
more; but Sivori has genius. His playing bewildered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
me; I did not understand it. It seemed to me like a
chaos that might become a world of beauty could I only
find the word that should reduce it to order. I went
home unhappy and indignant at being obliged to pass
life in such a stupid place, amongst such stupid people,
where is neither beauty, nor intelligence, nor goodness.
The next concert it went better with me. I sat near the
platform immediately in front of Sivori, and examined
his countenance, which certainly renders his performance
clearer. He is very small, his head large for his body, a
fine forehead, grand eyes, a stiff, sober manner, and
occasional half-suppressed smile that reminded me continually
of Ellery Channing. The first piece, ‘Il Campanello’
of Paganini, was a gem; the solemn, subduing
<i>adagio</i>, with a wild, striving conclusion, and the little
clear silver bell coming in continually, like an angel’s
voice in the conflict of good and bad spirits. Then his
prayer from ‘Moïse,’ performed on one string, was the
most devout music I ever listened to. I felt as if I were
worshipping in an old cathedral at twilight, and I shut
my eyes not to destroy the illusion by the expressionless
concert-room and faces all round. The duet between
Herz and Sivori was grand, both parts were so perfect.
I went to the concert with a prejudice against Herz, from
knowing his very bad moral character; but his playing is
very brilliant, though he is far from being a De Meyer.
He has the most self-satisfied expression in his mouth,
which, as a gentleman remarked, ‘seems to be going to
eat his ears,’ it is so large. He was recalled after one of
his pieces, and said, smiling, ‘I will play you a piece
which I composed, since I am in Charleston. It is called
“Souvenir de Charleston.”’ ’Twas quite a dashing affair;
and then he extemporised beautifully on ‘Lucy Long.’
I hope you may have the pleasure in Cincinnati of
hearing these real artists. Oh for the time when such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
music may be a daily feast for all, and when the performers
shall be as noble in character as they are gifted
in talent!

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,—Two letters from you within a
twelvemonth seems as extraordinary as it is welcome. I
was much gratified by the kind home voices which greeted
my birthday. I always think of old family times on that
day—the penny for each year which father used laughingly
to bestow, and the silver that came after, and then
the little children’s party, and all the merry old times;
but I am quite satisfied that my childhood has gone; I
never wish to recall it, happy as it was; I want to be up
and doing, not simply enjoying myself; and if I never
succeed in accomplishing all my intentions, I mean to
have the comfortable assurance that I have tried hard
and done my best. Your letter, besides its highly respected
religious advice, which I always lay up carefully
in a little scented corner of my mind, contains many little
interesting domestic items. How I should like to tap at
the window some night, while the brilliant solar lamp is
illuminating the planets and glorifying the cheerful faces
inside, and make you all start as if you saw a ghost, till a
most substantial shaking of the hand should convince
you to the contrary! We have had a very mild winter
on the whole, to my no small delight, for I dreaded the
cold exceedingly in this great house, where the wind
rushes grievously through every door and window and
finds only the ghost of a fire to warm it, and where heavy
mists from the ocean chill the very marrow of your bones.
I’ve fortunately had no broken chilblains on my hands
this winter, and as I teach in the warmest room in the
house, and throw open the shutters to let in all the sunshine,
I don’t often have to wear my blanket, but get
along pretty comfortably. I am teaching at present more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
than eight hours a day, and you may imagine I get pretty
tired by tea-time. Such a press of teaching, however, will
not last very long, and I am quite willing that Mrs.
Du Pré should gain as much as possible by me while I
am with her.
</p>

<p>
About a week ago I received an answer from the old
Quaker physician, Dr. Warrington of Philadelphia, to
whom I was introduced by Mrs. Willard of Troy some
time ago. The letter is quite an original; I must transcribe
a little for your benefit:—
</p>

<p>
‘<span class="smcap">My dear E. Blackwell</span>,—Thy letter of November 18
came duly to hand; it has indeed remained unanswered,
but not unheeded. I have reflected much on the propositions
contained in it; so strong a hold has the communication
had on my feelings and sympathies that I feared I
might speak imprudently if I should reply impromptu to
such noble sentiments. I have myself been so circumstanced
in life as to be rendered measurably competent
to understand the force of promptings to move in somewhat
new and little-tried paths. My immediate response
would therefore perhaps have been, “Go onwards;” and
though if in reasonings with flesh and blood in this
matter I may appear less ardent in my encouragement,
let it be borne in mind that He who puts forth can without
fail lead His devoted servants; He can make a way
where there appeared to be no way; He can accomplish
His purposes by instruments of His own selection in the
bringing about His own ends—“God shall work, and who
shall let (hinder or prevent) Him?”
</p>

<p>
‘Now, this principle is recognisable by the pious of all
denominations. It is one which has been found operative
in very many important enterprises, and it is one
which thy own mind seems so firmly to have settled that
I scarcely need advert to it now, but to show that my
own faith may sometimes be so feeble that I enter into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
human calculation as to the expediency of certain plans
of operation which have suggested themselves to me in
the course of my movements about this great city, or
when I am reflecting upon the condition of humanity at
large. Now, I frankly confess that it is in such a balance
that I have from time to time weighed thy interesting
concern. I have personally appealed to some of the
most intelligent and liberal-minded ladies of my acquaintance
how far the services of a well-educated female physician
would be appreciated by them. The response
uniformly is, “Mrs. Gove and Mrs. Wright were unfit to
teach, nor could any female become acceptable to us,
either as a teacher or practitioner of medicine.” This
language is stronger than I should be willing to use
myself. It is an interesting matter of history, and one
which may afford some encouragement to reformers to
persevere, when they are assured that their cause has its
foundation in truth, justice, and mercy; that Saul, who
had been most bitter in his persecution of Christians,
joining in the popular outcry against the great Innovator,
not only himself became a convert to the new faith, but
under the name of Paul, for the balance of his active life,
employed his powerful talents in the extension of the
very doctrines which in his misguided zeal he had
laboured to subvert. I confess, my dear lady, that I
with thee see many difficulties in the way to the attainment—firstly,
to the acquisition of the kind and amount of
education thou art aware is necessary as a <i>capital stock</i>
with which to begin the enterprise which has been opened
to thy mind; secondly, that after years spent in the
attempt the popular mind will be found barred against
thy mission of love and humanity; but I beg thee to
believe with me that if the project be of divine origin
and appointment it will sooner or later surely be accomplished.
Thus, in the language of Gamaliel on another
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
occasion, “If this work be of men it will come to nought,
but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye
be found even to fight against God.” In now addressing
thee personally I cordially reiterate the invitation. I
should be happy to compare notes with thee at any
leisure moment which may be afforded me, though I am
in the whirl of occupation; and if after our conferences
together thou shouldest become as persuaded as I am
that woman was designed to be the helpmeet for man,
and that in the responsible duties of relieving ills which
flesh is heir to it is appropriate that man be the <i>physician</i>
and woman the <i>nurse</i>, it may possibly occur to thee that
thy real mission in this world of probation will be to contribute
with all the talents which thy Father in Heaven
has so bountifully bestowed the exaltation of a portion of
thy sex to the holy duties of nursing the sick, and thus
succouring the distressed. With sentiments of most
respectful consideration....’
</p>

<p>
This is a portion of the good Doctor’s letter, and
though our opinions differ considerably I cannot complain
of his treating the matter too lightly. He seems to be an
honest, simple-minded, enthusiastic old man, and I feel
as if I might regard him as a friend in Philadelphia. The
letter is copied by his wife in a clear, pretty hand, so I
consider her as interested also.
</p>

<p>
Well, my dear mother, I wish I could tell you something
amusing; but though we do a good deal of small
laughing, it would hardly be worth while to put our jokes
down on paper. Miss Buell and I talk of hiring a beau if
we can get one cheap, for really these beautiful moonlight
nights a walk on the Battery would be very pleasant, and
a visit to the opera that is now in town would be by
no means disagreeable; but now we have to sit at our
window and admire the moonlight on the waters, and sigh
in vain after the vanities of the world, all for want of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
beau—alas! poor nuns that we are. Then sometimes the
girls get up a little screaming for our benefit. The other
night, for instance, the ten o’clock bell had rung. Miss
Buell had seen that the lights were out and the girls in
bed. We were comfortably sinking into forgetfulness on
our pillows, when I fancied I heard some poor dog yelling
in some yard. I listened sympathisingly, and found it
was a human voice in the distance uttering at short
intervals a succession of agonised shrieks. I was horrified
and indignant. ‘Do listen,’ I cried; ‘they must be
whipping a poor negro; isn’t it abominable?’ We listened;
the shrieks seemed to draw nearer. ‘Why, Miss
Buell, ’tis certainly the girls in the opposite room!’ ‘Oh,
no, they are all asleep; ’tis sonny’s voice downstairs:
they must be washing him.’ ‘At this time of night!
What an idea! I’m convinced it is the girls.’ The shrieks
increased, and at intervals we distinguished the words:
‘Oh, Penny, Penny Grimke! Oh, Miss Buell, Miss Blackwell,
Mrs. Peters! Oh, Mrs. Peters!’ I jumped out of
bed, got a light, and hurried into the opposite room; as I
opened the door the noise almost stunned me. There
were six girls, all screaming at the top of their voices, as
pale as their nightgowns, and some of them almost in
fits; all the other doors were thrown open, and I was
immediately surrounded by a perfect mob of girls in
white nightgowns and caps, talking, crying, laughing, in
a regular uproar. I threatened to blow out the lamp, to
call Mr. Bonnetheau, to beat them all if they wouldn’t
hush, and at last I got at the origin of the affray. A
couple of brushes had fallen on the floor, and one of the
girls, affirming that somebody had touched her arm, began
to scream; all the others joined in, and I really believe
that if I had not gone to them when I did they would
have fallen into convulsions, so completely had they
given themselves up to terror. These are some of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
pleasant diversions of our life, and as I welcome anything
that makes me laugh, they are quite acceptable.
</p>

<p>
When the hot weather arrived I superintended
the summer school, which for the health of the
pupils was removed to Aiken, South Carolina, amongst
the pine barrens; a spot renowned for its healthiness,
and which has since become a famous health
resort.

Aiken: July 1846.
</p>

<p>
Many happy returns, dear M., of your birthday. I
send you the old greeting; old, and full of meaning; for
life is a blessing, though our low, unworthy view may
make us sometimes doubt it. Even if life were full of
suffering, and annihilation its end, I should still hail it as
a noble gift. But with a firm faith in infinite goodness
and immortality, the most wearisome life becomes a
source of triumphant thanksgiving. So I wish you again
many happy returns of glorious life! And now I must
thank you right heartily for a letter that was a real home
gift; or, as the ‘Dial’ saith, ‘a letter that was no letter, but
a leaf out of the book of Nature.’ How do your commentatical
studies go on? I am afraid it will be an
unsatisfactory sort of business to search for the sun with
a parcel of rushlights; if it do not glow forth with
unmistakable brilliancy I fear there’s very little true
solar light to be found. Last Sunday, not caring to pay
the Episcopal church a second visit, I told Mrs. Du Pré I
would go to a church in the woods, so she need not send
the carriage back for me. I had seen a dark wooden
building with little steeple, half hidden amongst the trees,
that took my fancy. So I dressed and strolled through
the sandy wood paths at the rate of a mile an hour, as I
hate overheating myself. I reached my church at length,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
when, lo! it proved to be a deserted schoolhouse, containing
two large cool rooms, built of weather-beaten pine,
with projecting roof and pleasant elevated porch. Here
I took my seat, whilst the village bells were ringing
merrily. The schoolhouse was situated in the midst of
pretty woods, encircled by a path of white sand which
winds through the woods to the village. The sky was
brilliantly blue; the rich odour of the pines and the hum
of insects had a very soothing effect, and I spent my
time so pleasantly that I think I shall be tempted to pay
my church in the woods many visits this summer. By-the-by,
I find that the schoolhouse, cool and pleasant
as it is, has been for some time deserted, because the
three denominations of Aiken cannot agree on the choice
of a teacher. I have found the summer here very pleasant
hitherto. Indeed, I invite you all to come South and
get cool; I think I have never suffered so little from heat
anywhere.
</p>

<p>
<i>November.</i>—Let me set your mind at ease with regard
to my fastidiousness, love of beauty, professional horrors,
and so forth. My mind is fully made up. I have not
the slightest hesitation on the subject; the thorough
study of medicine I am quite resolved to go through
with. The horrors and disgusts I have no doubt of vanquishing.
I have overcome stronger distastes than any
that now remain, and feel fully equal to the contest. As
to the opinion of people, I don’t care one straw <i>personally</i>;
though I take so much pains, as a matter of
policy, to propitiate it, and shall always strive to do so;
for I see continually how the highest good is eclipsed by
the violent or disagreeable forms which contain it. I
think you attribute a foolish sentimental fastidiousness to
me that I do not possess. You also speak of my want of
bodily sympathy being an objection. If I understand
what you mean, I think it would prove of the most valuable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
assistance possible. I suspect you were thinking of
that unlucky dose of lobelia I once gave you when I grew
angry because you groaned and groaned, and obstinately
refused to drink the warm stuff that would relieve you. I
think I have sufficient hardness to be entirely unaffected
by great agony in such a way as to impair the clearness
of thought necessary for bringing relief, but I am sure the
warmest sympathy would prompt me to relieve suffering
to the extent of my power; though I do not think any
case would keep me awake at night, or that the responsibility
would seem too great when I had conscientiously
done my best.... I want very much to have a little
story printed which I have translated from the German.
It is very pretty, and pleases the children greatly. I
might get a hundred dollars for it.... Aiken is almost
deserted, but I shall not go down till the 15th, when the
Episcopal minister arrives to take charge of the school.
To-morrow I shall be left entirely alone, not a soul in the
house besides; and only a negro man somewhat given to
drink and a negro woman greatly given to scolding in the
yard.... The autumn winds are howling round the
house, blowing the leaves in whirlwinds. Our ‘Fall’ has
been very pleasant, though we’ve had fires for several
weeks. The changing trees had a curious effect for a few
days. I have four windows in my room, and the hickory
trees outside turned a brilliant yellow, filling the room
with a beautiful glow. During a very rainy day I several
times looked up with joy thinking the sun was breaking
forth; but the rain soon changed their beauty, and now
our pines and some oaks are the only cheerful things
left.

CHAPTER III
<br />
<span  class="subhead">
STUDY IN AMERICA
<br />

1847-1849
</span>
</h2>


<p>
In the summer of 1847, with my carefully hoarded
earnings, I resolved to seek an entrance into a
medical school. Philadelphia was then considered
the chief seat of medical learning in America, so to
Philadelphia I went; taking passage in a sailing
vessel from Charleston for the sake of economy.
</p>

<p>
In Philadelphia I boarded in the family of Dr.
William Elder. He and his admirable wife soon
became warm and steadfast friends. Dr. Elder
(author of the life of Dr. Kane, the Arctic voyager)
was a remarkable man, of brilliant talent and genial
nature. He took a generous interest in my plans,
helping by his advice and encouragement through
the months of effort and refusals which were now
encountered.
</p>

<p>
Applications were cautiously but persistently
made to the four medical colleges of Philadelphia for
admission as a regular student. The interviews with
their various professors were by turns hopeful and
disappointing. Whilst pursuing these inquiries I
commenced my anatomical studies in the private
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
school of Dr. Allen. This gentleman by his thoughtful
arrangements enabled me to overcome the natural
repulsion to these studies generally felt at the outset.
With a tact and delicacy for which I have always
felt grateful, he gave me as my first lesson in
practical anatomy a demonstration of the human
wrist. The beauty of the tendons and exquisite
arrangements of this part of the body struck my
artistic sense, and appealed to the sentiment of
reverence with which this anatomical branch of
study was ever afterwards invested in my mind.
</p>

<p>
During the following months, whilst making
applications to the different medical colleges of
Philadelphia for admission as a regular student,
I enlisted the services of my friends in the search
for an Alma Mater. The interviews with the
various professors, though disappointing, were often
amusing.
</p>


<h3>
<i>Extracts from the Journal of 1847</i>
</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>May 27.</i>—Called on Dr. Jackson (one of the oldest
professors in Philadelphia), a small, bright-faced, grey-haired
man, who looked up from his newspaper and
saluted me with, ‘Well, what is it? What do you want?’
I told him I wanted to study medicine. He began to
laugh, and asked me why. Then I detailed my plans.
He became interested; said he would not give me an
answer then; that there were great difficulties, but he
did not know that they were insurmountable; he would
let me know on Monday. I came home with a lighter
heart, though I can hardly say I hope. On Monday Dr.
Jackson said he had done his best for me, but the professors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
were all opposed to my entrance. Dr. Horner
advised me to try the Filbert Street and Franklin schools.
A professor of Jefferson College thought it would be
impossible to study there, and advised the New England
schools.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 2.</i>—Felt gloomy as thunder, trudging round to
Dr. Darrach. He is the most non-committal man I ever
saw. I harangued him, and he sat full five minutes
without a word. I asked at last if he could give me any
encouragement. ‘The subject is a novel one, madam, I
have nothing to say either for or against it; you have
awakened trains of thought upon which my mind is
taking action, but I cannot express my opinion to you
either one way or another.’ ‘Your opinion, I fear, is
unfavourable.’ ‘I did not say so. I beg you, madam,
distinctly to understand that I express no opinion one
way or another; the way in which my mind acts in this
matter I do not feel at liberty to unfold.’ ‘Shall I call
on the other professors of your college?’ ‘I cannot take
the responsibility of advising you to pursue such a
course.’ ‘Can you not grant me admittance to your
lectures, as you do not feel unfavourable to my scheme?’
‘I have said no such thing; whether favourable or
unfavourable, I have not expressed any opinion; and I
beg leave to state clearly that the operation of my mind
in regard to this matter I do not feel at liberty to unfold.’
I got up in despair, leaving his mind to take action on
the subject at his leisure.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Warrington told me that he had seen his friend
Dr. Ashmead, who had told him that Paris was such a
horrible place that I must give up my wish for a medical
education—indeed, his communication would be so unfavourable
that he would rather not meet me in person.
I told the Doctor that if the path of duty led me to hell
I would go there; and I did not think that by being with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
devils I should become a devil myself—at which the
good Doctor stared.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I shrink extremely from the idea of
giving up the attempt in America and going to France,
although the suggestion is often urged on me.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
The fear of successful rivalry which at that time
often existed in the medical mind was expressed
by the dean of one of the smaller schools, who
frankly replied to the application, ‘You cannot
expect us to furnish you with a stick to break our
heads with;’ so revolutionary seemed the attempt
of a woman to leave a subordinate position and seek
to obtain a complete medical education. A similarly
mistaken notion of the rapid practical success which
would attend a lady doctor was shown later by one
of the professors of my medical college, who was
desirous of entering into partnership with me on
condition of sharing profits over 5,000 dollars on my
first year’s practice.
</p>

<p>
During these fruitless efforts my kindly Quaker
adviser, whose private lectures I attended, said to
me: ‘Elizabeth, it is of no use trying. Thee cannot
gain admission to these schools. Thee must go to
Paris and don masculine attire to gain the necessary
knowledge.’ Curiously enough, this suggestion of
disguise made by good Dr. Warrington was also
given me by Doctor Pankhurst, the Professor of
Surgery in the largest college in Philadelphia. He
thoroughly approved of a woman’s gaining complete
medical knowledge; told me that although my
public entrance into the classes was out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
question, yet if I would assume masculine attire and
enter the college he could entirely rely on two or
three of his students to whom he should communicate
my disguise, who would watch the class and
give me timely notice to withdraw should my
disguise be suspected.
</p>

<p>
But neither the advice to go to Paris nor the
suggestion of disguise tempted me for a moment.
It was to my mind a moral crusade on which I had
entered, a course of justice and common sense, and
it must be pursued in the light of day, and with
public sanction, in order to accomplish its end.
</p>

<p>
The following letter to Mrs. Willard of Troy,
the well-known educationalist, describes the difficulties
through which the young student had to
walk warily:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia: May 24.
</p>

<p>
I cannot refrain from expressing my obligations to
you for directing me to the excellent Dr. Warrington.
He has allowed me to visit his patients, attend his
lectures, and make use of his library, and has spoken to
more than one medical friend concerning my wishes; but
with deep regret I am obliged to say that all the information
hitherto obtained serves to show me the impossibility
of accomplishing my purpose in America. I find
myself rigidly excluded from the regular college routine,
and there is no thorough course of lectures that can
supply its place. The general sentiment of the physicians
is strongly opposed to a woman’s intruding herself into
the profession; consequently it would be perhaps impossible
to obtain private instruction, but if that were
possible, the enormous expense would render it impracticable,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
and where the feelings of the profession are
strongly enlisted against such a scheme, the museums,
libraries, hospitals, and all similar aids would be closed
against me. In view of these and numerous other
difficulties Dr. Warrington is discouraged, and joins with
his medical brethren in advising me to give up the
scheme. But a strong idea, long cherished till it has
taken deep root in the soul and become an all-absorbing
duty, cannot thus be laid aside. I must accomplish my
end. I consider it the noblest and most useful path that
I can tread, and if one country rejects me I will go to
another.
</p>

<p>
Through Dr. Warrington and other sources I am
informed that my plan can be carried out in Paris,
though the free Government lectures, delivered by the
faculty, are confined to men, and a diploma is strictly
denied to a woman, even when (as in one instance, as it
is said) she has gone through the course in male attire;
yet every year thorough courses of lectures are delivered
by able physicians on every branch of medical knowledge,
to which I should be admitted without hesitation
and treated with becoming respect. The true place for
study, then, seems open to me; but here, again, some
friendly physicians raise stronger objections than ever.
‘You, a young unmarried lady,’ they say, ‘go to Paris,
that city of fearful immorality, where every feeling will
be outraged and insult attend you at every step; where
vice is the natural atmosphere, and no young man can
breathe it without being contaminated! Impossible, you
are lost if you go!’
</p>

<p>
Now, dear madam, I appeal to you, who have had
the opportunity of studying the French in their native
land, is not this a false view, a greatly exaggerated fear?
Is it not perfectly true everywhere that a woman who
respects herself will be respected by others; that where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
the life is directed by a strong, pure motive to a noble
object, in a quiet, dignified, but determined manner, the
better feelings of mankind are enlisted, and the woman
excites esteem and respectful sympathy? To my mind
this is perfectly clear, and I trust that your more
experienced judgment will confirm my opinion. Probably,
then, if all the information which I am still collecting
agree with what I have already received, I may sail for
France in the course of the summer, that I may familiarise
myself with a rapid French delivery before the
commencement of the winter lectures.
</p>

<p>
I have tried to look every difficulty steadily in the
face. I find none which seem to me unconquerable, and
with the blessing of Providence I trust to accomplish my
design.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
After a short, refreshing trip with my family to
the seaside, the search was again renewed in Philadelphia.
But applications made for admission to
the medical schools both of Philadelphia and of New
York were met with similarly unsuccessful results.
</p>

<p>
I therefore obtained a complete list of all the
smaller schools of the Northern States, ‘country
schools,’ as they were called. I examined their prospectuses,
and quite at a venture sent in applications
for admission to twelve of the most promising institutions,
where full courses of instruction were
given under able professors. The result was awaited
with much anxiety, as the time for the commencement
of the winter sessions was rapidly approaching.
No answer came for some time. At last, to my
immense relief (though not surprise, for failure never
seemed possible), I received the following letter from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
the medical department of a small university town
in the western part of the State of New York:—

<p>
To Elizabeth Blackwell, Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
I am instructed by the faculty of the medical department
of Geneva University to acknowledge receipt of
yours of 3rd inst. A quorum of the faculty assembled
last evening for the first time during the session, and it was
thought important to submit your proposal to the class (of
students), who have had a meeting this day, and acted
entirely on their own behalf, without any interference on
the part of the faculty. I send you the result of their deliberations,
and need only add that there are no fears but
that you can, by judicious management, not only ‘disarm
criticism,’ but elevate yourself without detracting in the
least from the dignity of the profession.

Wishing you success in your undertaking, which some
may deem bold in the present state of society, I subscribe
myself,

This letter enclosed the following unique and
manly letter, which I had afterwards copied on
parchment, and esteem one of my most valued possessions:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At a meeting of the entire medical class of Geneva
Medical College, held this day, October 20, 1847, the
following resolutions were unanimously adopted:—
</p>

<p>
1. <i>Resolved</i>—That one of the radical principles of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
Republican Government is the universal education of
both sexes; that to every branch of scientific education
the door should be open equally to all; that the application
of Elizabeth Blackwell to become a member of our
class meets our entire approbation; and in extending our
unanimous invitation we pledge ourselves that no conduct
of ours shall cause her to regret her attendance at this
institution.
</p>

<p>
2. <i>Resolved</i>—That a copy of these proceedings be
signed by the chairman and transmitted to Elizabeth
Blackwell.
</p>


<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">T. J. Stratton</span>, <i>Chairman</i>.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
With an immense sigh of relief and aspiration of
profound gratitude to Providence I instantly accepted
the invitation, and prepared for the journey
to Western New York State.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Philadelphia on November 4, I hastened
through New York, travelled all night, and reached
the little town of Geneva at 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on November 6.
</p>

<p>
The next day, after a refreshing sleep, I sallied
forth for an interview with the dean of the college,
enjoying the view of the beautiful lake on which
Geneva is situated, notwithstanding the cold, drizzling,
windy day. After an interview with the
authorities of the college I was duly inscribed on
the list as student No. 130, in the medical department
of the Geneva University.
</p>

<p>
I at once established myself in a comfortable
boarding-house, in the same street as my college,
and three minutes’ walk from it—a beautiful walk
along the high bank overlooking the lake. I hung
my room with dear mementoes of absent friends,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
and soon with hope and zeal and thankful feelings
of rest I settled down to study.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, some little time was required to adjust
the relations of the new student to her unusual surroundings.
My first experiences are thus given in
a letter to a sister:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
Geneva: November 9, 1847.
</p>

<p>
I’ve just finished copying the notes of my last lecture.
Business is over for to-day; I throw a fresh stick into my
‘air-tight,’ and now for refreshment by a talk with my own
dear sister. Your letter containing E.’s was the first to
welcome me in my new residence; right welcome, I assure
you, it was, for I was gloomy—very. It was on Monday
evening your letter came—my first work-day in Geneva.
It had rained incessantly; I was in an upper room of a
large boarding-house without a soul to speak to. I had
attended five lectures, but nevertheless I did not know
whether I could do what I ought to, for the Professor of
Anatomy was absent, and had been spoken of as a queer
man. The demonstrator hesitated as to my dissecting;
I had no books, and didn’t know where to get any; and
my head was bewildered with running about the great
college building—never going out of the same door I went
in at.
</p>

<p>
This evening, however, I have finished my second
day’s lectures; the weather is still gloomy, but I feel
sunshiny and happy, strongly encouraged, with a grand
future before me, and all owing to a fat little fairy in the
shape of the Professor of Anatomy! This morning, on
repairing to the college, I was introduced to Dr. Webster,
the Professor of Anatomy, a little plump man, blunt in
manner and very voluble. He shook me warmly by the
hand, said my plan was capital; he had some fun too
about a lady pupil, for he never lost a joke; the class had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
acted manfully; their resolutions were as good as a political
meeting, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
He asked me what branches I had studied. I told him
all but surgery. ‘Well,’ said Dr. Lee, ‘do you mean to
practise surgery?’ ‘Why, of course she does,’ broke in
Dr. Webster. ‘Think of the cases of femoral hernia; only
think what a well-educated woman would do in a city like
New York. Why, my dear sir, she’d have her hands full
in no time; her success would be immense. Yes, yes,
you’ll go through the course, and get your diploma with
great <i>éclat</i> too; we’ll give you the opportunities. You’ll
make a stir, I can tell you.’
</p>

<p>
I handed him a note of introduction from Dr. Warrington,
and then he told me to wait in the ante-room
while he read it to the medical class, who were assembled
in the amphitheatre for his lecture, which was to be preparatory
to one of the most delicate operations in surgery,
and I suppose he wanted to remind them of their promise
of good behaviour. I could hear him reading it. When
his age and experience were spoken of there was a shout
of laughter, for he can’t be more than forty-five and not
much of dignity about him; but at the conclusion there
was a round of applause, after which I quietly entered,
and certainly have no reason to complain of medical
students, for though they eye me curiously, it is also in a
very friendly manner. After the lecture was over, the
demonstrator, who now shows the utmost friendliness,
explained to me at the Doctor’s request a very important
subject which I had lost. It was admirably done, illustrated
on the subject, and if to-day’s lessons were a fair
specimen, I certainly shall have no cause to complain of
my anatomical instructors. The plan pursued here is
admirable, and New York and Philadelphia may learn
more than one lesson from Geneva. Dr. Webster came
to me laughing after the first lecture, saying: ‘You attract
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
too much attention, Miss Blackwell; there was a very
large number of strangers present this afternoon—I shall
guard against this in future.’ ‘Yes,’ said Dr. Lee; ‘we
were saying to-day that this step might prove quite a good
advertisement for the college; if there were no other
advantage to be gained, it will attract so much notice.
I shall bring the matter into the medical journals; why,
I’ll venture to say in ten years’ time one-third the classes
in our colleges will consist of women. After the precedent
you will have established, people’s eyes will be
opened.’
</p>

<p>
Now, all this kind feeling encourages me greatly, and
I need it; for though my purpose has never wavered, a
flat, heavy feeling was growing upon me from constant
disappointment. I was fast losing that spring of hope
that is so pleasant; consequently praise cannot make me
vain, and the notice I attract is a matter of perfect indifference.
I sit quietly in this large assemblage of young
men, and they might be women or mummies for aught I
care. I sometimes think I’m too much disciplined, but
it is certainly necessary for the position I occupy. I believe
the professors don’t exactly know in what species of
the human family to place me, and the students are a
little bewildered. The other people at first regarded me
with suspicion, but I am so quiet and gentle that suspicion
turns to astonishment, and even the little boys in
the street stand still and stare as I pass. ’Tis droll;
sometimes I laugh, sometimes I feel a little sad, but in
Geneva the nine days’ wonder soon will cease, and I
cannot but congratulate myself on having found at last
the right place for my beginning.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
I had not the slightest idea of the commotion
created by my appearance as a medical student in
the little town. Very slowly I perceived that a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
doctor’s wife at the table avoided any communication
with me, and that as I walked backwards and
forwards to college the ladies stopped to stare at
me, as at a curious animal. I afterwards found
that I had so shocked Geneva propriety that the
theory was fully established either that I was a bad
woman, whose designs would gradually become
evident, or that, being insane, an outbreak of insanity
would soon be apparent. Feeling the unfriendliness
of the people, though quite unaware of
all this gossip, I never walked abroad, but hastening
daily to my college as to a sure refuge, I knew
when I shut the great doors behind me that I shut
out all unkindly criticism, and I soon felt perfectly
at home amongst my fellow-students.
</p>

<p>
The following extracts from my journal of those
days show how any early difficulties were successfully
overcome:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>November 9.</i>—My first happy day; I feel really
encouraged. The little fat Professor of Anatomy is a
capital fellow; certainly I shall love fat men more than
lean ones henceforth. He gave just the go-ahead directing
impulse needful; he will afford me every advantage,
and says I shall graduate with <i>éclat</i>. Then, too, I am
glad that they like the notoriety of the thing, and think
it a good ‘spec.’
</p>

<p>
<i>November 10.</i>—Attended the demonstrator’s evening
lecture—very clear—how superior to books! Oh, this is
the way to learn! The class behaves very well; and
people seem all to grow kind.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 11.</i>—Anatomy very interesting to-day;
two admirable demonstrations. Dr. Webster, full of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
enthusiasm, told us of Godman, who was converted to
phrenology by reading a work against it, in order to cut
it up.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 15.</i>—To-day, a second operation at which
I was not allowed to be present. This annoys me. I
was quite saddened and discouraged by Dr. Webster
requesting me to be absent from some of his demonstrations.
I don’t believe it is his wish. I wrote to him
hoping to change things.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 17.</i>—Dr. Webster seemed much pleased
with my note, and quite cheered me by his wish to
read it to the class to-morrow, saying if they were all
actuated by such sentiments the medical class at Geneva
would be a very noble one. He could hardly guess how
much I needed a little praise. I have no fear of the kind
students.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 20.</i>—In the amphitheatre yesterday a little
folded paper dropped on my arms as I was making
notes; it looked very much as if there were writing in it,
but I shook it off and went on quietly with my notes.
Some after-demonstration of a similar kind produced a
hiss from the opposite side of the room. I felt also a very
light touch on my head, but I guess my quiet manner
will soon stop any nonsense.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 22.</i>—A trying day, and I feel almost worn
out, though it was encouraging too, and in some measure
a triumph; but ’tis a terrible ordeal! That dissection
was just as much as I could bear. Some of the students
blushed, some were hysterical, not one could keep in a
smile, and some who I am sure would not hurt my
feelings for the world if it depended on them, held down
their faces and shook. My delicacy was certainly shocked,
and yet the exhibition was in some sense ludicrous. I
had to pinch my hand till the blood nearly came, and call
on Christ to help me from smiling, for that would have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
ruined everything; but I sat in grave indifference, though
the effort made my heart palpitate most painfully. Dr.
Webster, who had perhaps the most trying position, behaved
admirably.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 24.</i>—To-day the Doctor read my note to the
class. In this note I told him that I was there as a
student with an earnest purpose, and as a student simply
I should be regarded; that the study of anatomy was a
most serious one, exciting profound reverence, and the
suggestion to absent myself from any lectures seemed to
me a grave mistake. I did not wish to do so, but would
yield to any wish of the class without hesitation, if it <i>was</i>
their desire. I stayed in the ante-room whilst the note
was being read. I listened joyfully to the very hearty
approbation with which it was received by the class, and
then entered the amphitheatre and quietly resumed my
place. The Doctor told me he felt quite relieved.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
No further difficulty ever afterwards occurred.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>December 4.</i>—Dr. Webster sent for me to examine a
case of a poor woman at his rooms. ’Twas a horrible
exposure; indecent for any poor woman to be subjected
to such a torture; she seemed to feel it, poor and ignorant
as she was. I felt more than ever the necessity of my
mission. But I went home out of spirits, I hardly know
why. I felt alone. I must work by myself all life long.
</p>

<p>
<i>Christmas Day.</i>—Bright and gay with sleighs. The
lake looks most beautiful, the mist rising from it in arches,
the sky a brilliant blue, and the ground covered with
snow. I received my Christmas Annual with great joy;
and having purchased 25 cents’ worth of almonds and
raisins, I had quite a cosy time reading it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sunday, January 16.</i>—A most beautiful day; it did me
good. The text impressed itself on me—‘Thou wilt keep
him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee.’ I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
felt happy and blessed. Ah! if the Almighty would
always shine on me, how strong I should be! ‘The Lord
God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace and
glory; no good thing will He withhold from them that
walk uprightly.’
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
The behaviour of the medical class during the
two years that I was with them was admirable. It
was that of true Christian gentlemen. I learned
later that some of them had been inclined to think
my application for admission a hoax, perpetrated at
their expense by a rival college. But when the
<i>bona-fide</i> student actually appeared they gave her a
manly welcome, and fulfilled to the letter the promise
contained in their invitation.
</p>

<p>
My place in the various lecture-rooms was
always kept for me, and I was never in any way
molested. Walking down the crowded amphitheatre
after the class was seated, no notice was taken of
me. Whilst the class waited in one of the large
lecture-rooms for the Professor of Practice, groups
of the wilder students gathered at the windows,
which overlooked the grounds of a large normal
school for young ladies. The pupils of this institution
knew the hour of this lecture, and gathered at
their windows for a little fun. Here, peeping from
behind the blinds, they responded to the jests and
hurrahs of the students. ‘See the one in pink!’
‘No, look at the one with a blue tie; she has a
note,’ &amp;c.—fun suddenly hushed by the entrance
of the Professor. Meanwhile I had quietly looked
over my notes in the seat always reserved for me,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
entirely undisturbed by the frolic going on at the
windows.
</p>

<p>
My studies in anatomy were most thoughtfully
arranged by Dr. Le Ford, who selected four of the
steadier students to work with me in the private
room of the surgical professor, adjoining the amphitheatre.
There we worked evening after evening in
the most friendly way, and I gained curious glimpses
into the escapades of student life. Being several
years older than my companions, they treated me
like an elder sister, and talked freely together, feeling
my friendly sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Under the intelligent instruction of the demonstrator
anatomy became a most fascinating study.
The wonderful arrangements of the human body
excited an interest and admiration which simply
obliterated the more superficial feelings of repugnance;
and I passed hour after hour at night alone
in the college, tracing out the ramification of parts,
until, suddenly struck by the intense stillness around,
I found that it was nearly midnight, and the rest of
the little town asleep.
</p>

<p>
I was equally amazed and shocked some years
later, after dining with Mr. Walsh, the American
Consul in Paris, to learn that he had remarked that
he could not look at my long slender fingers without
thinking of the anatomical work in which they had
been engaged.
</p>

<p>
As the term drew to its end there was regret at
parting from friends I had made, and also anxiety
from the uncertainties that still attended my future
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
course. These feelings are expressed in my journal:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>January 21.</i>—I felt sad when the lectures actually
closed. I received a curious friendly letter from one of
the students, requesting the honour of an occasional correspondence.
It cheered me, funny as it was. Another
student told me he had a daguerreotype-room, and asked
me to sit for my likeness to-morrow; but I told him it
had annoyed me so much to see my name in the papers
that I certainly could not give my face too.<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> He said he
had thought of graduating in August, but now he was glad
he had not, as I intended returning to Geneva—too
funny!
</p>

<p>
<i>January 24.</i>—Went to Dr. Hadley for my certificate;
and attended the examinations. I suppose they were as
thorough as most; but they were certainly not much of
a test. Most of the students answered very well, but
some very badly.
</p>

<p>
Miss Waller gave me an oyster supper and we had a
very pleasant time. Mrs. Wilson convulsed us by an
account of how she was actually struck down by the
sudden braying of a jackass, which she heard for the first
time during a visit to the North, she never having heard
the bray before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
</p>

<p>

<i>January 25.</i>—Attended Commencement (or ceremony
of graduation), which after all was not so very formidable.
When I went to wish Dr. Hadley good-bye I found the
whole faculty assembled, and very merry at breaking up.
They talked over my affairs, but gave me no important
advice. To my great disappointment no letters of introduction
were prepared for me, but only a promise given
that they should be sent on at once. I was very sad at
parting from the Wallers; but had a pleasant chat with
the students whom I found in the railroad cars.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
Passing through New York, where I dined with
my kind preceptor, Dr. S. H. Dickson, and his wife,
then living in the town, I returned to Philadelphia
to try and arrange for summer study. Whilst seeking
medical opportunities I again stayed in Dr.
Elder’s family, and endeavoured to increase my
slender finances by disposing of some stories I had
written, and by obtaining music pupils.
</p>

<p>
Knowing very little of practical medicine, I
finally decided to spend the summer, if possible,
studying in the hospital wards of the great Blockley
Almshouse of Philadelphia. This enormous institution
promised a fine field of observation. I obtained
a letter of introduction to Mr. Gilpin, one of the
directors of the almshouse.
</p>

<p>
He received me most kindly, but informed me
that the institution was so dominated by party feeling
that if he, as a Whig, should bring forward my
application for admission, it would be inevitably
opposed by the other two parties—viz. the Democrats
and the Native Americans. He said that my
only chance of admission lay in securing the support
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
of each of those parties, without referring in any way
to the other rival parties. I accordingly undertook
my sole act of ‘lobbying.’ I interviewed each political
leader with favourable results, and then sent in
my petition to the first Board meeting—when, lo! a
unique scene took place; all were prepared to fight
in my behalf, but there was no one to fight! I
was unanimously admitted to reside in the hospital.
This unanimity, I was afterwards assured, was quite
without precedent in the records of the institution.
</p>

<p>
On entering the Blockley Almshouse, a large
room on the third floor had been appropriated to my
use. It was in the women’s syphilitic department,
the most unruly part of the institution. It was
thought that my residence there might act as a
check on the very disorderly inmates. My presence
was a mystery to these poor creatures. I used to
hear stealthy steps approach and pause at my door,
evidently curious to know what I was about. So I
placed my table with the books and papers on which
I was engaged directly in a line with the keyhole;
and there I worked in view of any who chose to investigate
the proceedings of the mysterious stranger.
The following home letter gives a glimpse of the
Blockley life:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
August.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,—Do not fear for me. I go on
smoothly and healthily at Blockley; there is really
nothing pestilential amongst the diseases, and I live
simply, do my duty, trust in God, and mock at the devil!
The matron is the only lady in the establishment (present
company excepted), and I frequently step in to see her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
She wears a nice white cap, has smooth grey hair, and
soft dove’s eyes like yours, and I sometimes look at her
and think of you till her loud voice breaks forth in fierce
scolding, and then I think of Mrs. Beelzebub. She sits
in an immense room, in the centre of the almshouse
proper, and ensconced in her armchair, with feet propped
on a velvet footstool, she dispenses orders from morning
to night, gives out clothing, raves at the paupers, and
dooms the refractory ones to a shower-bath. She is a
Quaker—very pious, I believe—attends yearly meeting
regularly, and has an Episcopal minister for her only son;
she is one of the ‘strong-minded women,’ and manages
matters to the entire satisfaction of the committee. I
like to talk with her occasionally, for she is shrewd and
has seen much of life through dark spectacles.
</p>

<p>
What a contrast she is to our head physician! When
I first saw Dr. Benedict I thought him the very loveliest
man the Almighty ever created, and I still preserve my
opinion; the tears come into his eyes as he bends down
to soothe some dying woman, and his voice is as gentle,
his touch as kind to each patient as if she were his sister.
Then he is as truthful, energetic, and spirited as he is
kind, so, of course, we are very good friends, though we
don’t see much of each other.
</p>

<p>
I often send a thought to Cincinnati as I roam through
the wards and imagine our contrasted employments; all
letters unite in calling you the best, the most cheerful,
most indefatigable mother that ever did exist. ‘All her
daughters praise her, and her sons call her blessed.’
How I wish you could pay me another visit this summer!
Well, dear mother, Heaven bless you—write to
me sometime.
</p>


<p class="signature">
Your loving physician, E.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
At that time, and for many years after, the subject
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
which those wards where I lived represented
was an unknown problem to me. I was strangely
ignorant of the extent and meaning of that phase of
our human society which represents the selfish relations
of men and women. This semi-blindness,
however, proved a real safeguard to me through the
many unusual experiences of my subsequent life. It
was not until 1869, when attending the Social Science
Congress in Bristol, that my mind at last fully comprehended
the hideousness of modern fornication.
</p>

<p>
But my residence at Blockley prepared my mind
to some extent for later revelations, as is shown by
entries in my journal:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>June 22.</i>—I had a long talk with Nurse Welch, on
the patients in her departments, which impressed me
deeply. Most of the women are unmarried, a large proportion
having lived at service and been seduced by their
masters, though, on the whole, about as many seducers
are unmarried as married; I found no instance of a
married woman living with her husband entering.
</p>

<p>
This morning one young woman tried to escape from
Blockley by tying sheets together and fastening them
outside the window bars, but they giving way, she fell
down from the third storey, and was picked up suffering
from concussion of the brain and other injuries. All this
is horrible! Women must really open their eyes to it.
I am convinced that <i>they</i> must regulate this matter. But
how?
</p>

<p>
<i>August 17.</i>—Drank tea with the matron, and had a
very pleasant time. She excites me, and I influence her.
She actually apologised to me for her rough and tyrannical
treatment of one of the women.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 19.</i>—A beautiful thought came to me this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
lovely morning. Emerson says, ‘Our faith comes to us
in moments, our vice is habitual.’ I never till now could
explain this to my satisfaction. It is that the atmosphere
of our society, of our daily surroundings, is false; it
attracts the demons, they encompass us continually, for
we live in their home. The angels have to strive to
come to us. But when by a holy inspiration, or an effort
of man’s nobler nature, he rises to a purer sphere, then
the angels throng lovingly round him: he breathes the
Divine life. But the moment this effort is relaxed, he,
not living in a heavenly atmosphere, naturally and
inevitably sinks again into hell, because his present home
is there—for he cannot separate himself from the race.
Not till the <i>race</i> is redeemed will our habitual state be
heavenly, and the true spontaneous Divine life be possible.
This is the philosophy of effort. The solidarity of
our race asserts the impossibility of present permanent
Divine life. Bless God for our deep momentary experiences—our
prophetic assurances! This sweet morning
refreshes me inexpressibly. The wind that lifts my hair
seems filled with angel hands that soothe the soul to
peace; that little warbling bird fills me with holy joy; a
glory seems to rest everywhere, a tide from the Divine
Nature.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
During my residence at Blockley, the medical
head of the hospital, Dr. Benedict, was most kind,
and gave me every facility in his power. I had free
entry to all the women’s wards, and was soon on
good terms with the nurses. But the young resident
physicians, unlike their chief, were not friendly.
When I walked into the wards they walked out.
They ceased to write the diagnosis and treatment of
patients on the card at the head of each bed, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
had hitherto been the custom, thus throwing me
entirely on my own resources for clinical study.
</p>

<p>
During the summer of 1848 the famine fever was
raging in Ireland. Multitudes of emigrants were
attacked with fever whilst crossing the ocean, and
so many were brought to Blockley that it was difficult
to provide accommodation for them, many being
laid on beds on the floor. But this terrible epidemic
furnished an impressive object-lesson, and I chose
this form of typhus as the subject of my graduation
thesis, studying in the midst of the poor dying
sufferers who crowded the hospital wards. I read
my thesis to Dr. Elder, and was greatly encouraged
by his hearty approbation.
</p>

<p>
Trying as my painful residence at Blockley had
been both to body and mind, I was conscious of the
great gain in medical knowledge and worldly experience
which it had afforded. The following journal
entry expresses the mixed feelings with which that
strange residence was left:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>September 22.</i>—My last evening at Blockley. Here I
sit writing by my first fire. How glad I am, to-morrow,
to-morrow, I go home to my friends! And yet as I
watched the beautiful sunset from my great windows, as
little Mary Ann pays her willing attendance, and all
seems so friendly; as I walked to Dr. Benedict’s with
my thesis, and felt the entrancing day and the lovely
country, I <i>almost</i> regretted that I was going to leave.
Heaven guide me! May good spirits ever surround me!
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
At the end of the summer I gladly returned to
the healthy and hopeful college life at Geneva.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
Passing through New York, where I saw Dr. Dickson
and his family and heard Henry Ward Beecher
preach, I reached my winter’s home on October 3,
reported myself at college, met everywhere a kind
welcome, and settled down for winter work. The
clever demonstrator again afforded me his valuable
aid in anatomy, and the friendliness of the class continued.
Sometimes, whilst sitting by the Doctor
during some delicate demonstration of the brain,
the students who were crowding round, standing on
chairs, leaning on one another’s shoulders, kept most
respectfully from me, drawing back instantly when
by accident they touched my head or shoulder.<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>October 26.</i>—The class held a meeting to-day to request
a holiday on election day; and a political division was
called for by the assembled students. I went over to the
‘Free Soil’ side, and was received with repeated cheering.
I asked Dr. Le Ford, reproachfully, if he was going to
vote for the slave-holder, Taylor; whereupon he gave me
his reasons for political action, and grew quite eloquent
in his self-defence.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 12.</i>—Howy made his appearance to-day, just
as I settled down to perpetrate an essay for the family
Christmas Annual. How good it is to see a brother!
He looked very well, and we had a merry time together.
I stayed away from afternoon lectures to be with him.
He is a capital companion and greatly improved. I did
more laughing than I’ve done for months. His visit did
me real good, for I have been so lonely. Heaven bless
the dear boy in his future!
</p>

<p>
<i>Sunday, 19th.</i>—Alone all day in my room, yet anything
but lonely. Bright visions of usefulness have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
floating round me. I consecrated myself anew to the
accomplishment of a great idea. I tried to lecture for an
hour to an imaginary audience; striving to prepare for
work by seeking expression for my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I would I were not so exclusively a doer; speech
seems essential to the reformer, but mine is at present a
very stammering, childish utterance.
</p>

<p>
<i>26th.</i>—Went to church. Mr. Hogarth said some true
things. He drew our thoughts to the reformers of old,
with their sublime trust in the Most High. With a
strange feeling of pleasure I claimed kindred with Asa,
King of Judah, who broke the idols of the people and
overcame the hosts of the Ethiopians.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 30.</i>—Our evening lecture broke up in a political
Hurrah! for a Whig orator and John Van Buren were
both speaking in the town, and the students rushed to
attend the political meetings. I again discussed the subject
with Dr. Le Ford; he justifying himself enthusiastically
for being a Whig. He talked well, but I grew
tired of those old expediences.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
By this time the genuine character of my medical
studies was fully established.
</p>

<p>
Had I been at leisure to seek social acquaintance,
I might have been cordially welcomed. But my
time was anxiously and engrossingly occupied with
studies and the approaching examinations. I lived
in my room and my college, and the outside world
made little impression on me.
</p>


<h3>
<i>Extracts from the Journal.</i>
</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>December 22.</i>—The deepest snow I have seen for years.
It was as much as I could do to walk to college; but all
was pleasant, the class seem so very friendly. One set
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
me a chair, another spoke so pleasantly, and I had several
little friendly chats. How little they know my sensitiveness
to these trifling tokens! The unusual weather, an
alarm of fire, Dr. Webster’s arrival, were so many points
for sociability.
</p>

<p>
<i>December 31.</i>—The New Year’s Eve. Alone, as usual,
I spent the day; at night, as I watched the last moments
of the year slowly depart, a deep solemnity came over
me—a hopeless sorrow for poor humanity. I seemed to
hear the heavy resounding bell of time, tolling mournfully
the dying year, whilst angels with covered faces, and
forms that bent with sorrow, waited to receive the finishing
scroll of the world’s existence, that the fearful record
guarded in darkness and silence might at last be unrolled
in the terrible light of eternity!
</p>

<p>
<i>January 1.</i>—Stayed quietly in my room, whilst the
merry sleigh-bells and gay voices rang without.
</p>

<p>
<i>11th.</i>—I called to see the pretty blind girl operated on
this morning; she was all alone in the hotel, her friends
far away. Poor child! she has no protector, within or
without; she asked me who the student was that brought
her home, when college would be out, &amp;c.; her simple
heart and idle fancy are soon caught. Such are the
women I long to surround with my stronger arm. Alas!
how almost hopeless does the task seem! But God is
omnipotent.
</p>

<p>
<i>January 19.</i>—Dear M.,—I sit down to try and quiet
myself by writing to you for this morning. I, as first
on the list of candidates, passed through the usual
examinations, presented my certificates, received the
testimony of satisfaction from the faculty, whose recommendation
will procure me the diploma next Tuesday.
Now, though the examinations were not very formidable,
still the anxiety and effort were as great as if everything
were at stake, and when I came from the room and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
joined the other candidates who were anxiously awaiting
their turn, my face burned, my whole being was excited,
but a great load was lifted from my mind. The students
received me with applause—they all seem to like me, and
I believe I shall receive my degree with their united
approval; a generous and chivalric feeling having conquered
any little feelings of jealousy. I often feel when
I am with them how beautiful the relations of man and
woman might be under a truer development of character,
in nobler circumstances. I do not know the moral character
of any one of our students, for I have no genius for
hunting up the darker parts of a person’s soul; but I know
that Geneva is a very immoral place, the lower classes of
women being often worthless, the higher ones fastidious
and exclusive, so that there is no healthy blending of the
sexes. But notwithstanding the bad associations in
which they may have been brought up, I have never had
any difficulty in giving the right tone to our intercourse.
I am more convinced than ever that Fourier is right in
placing this matter in the hands of women, and my hope
rises when I find that the inner heart of the human being
may still remain pure, notwithstanding some corruption
of the outer coverings. I don’t know if I’ve ever told you
how deep this matter of licentiousness has gradually
sunk into my soul, and that the determination to wage a
war of extermination with it strengthens continually, and
the hope of gaining power and experience to do it
worthily is one of my strongest supports in action. So
help me God, I will not be blind, indifferent, or stupid
in relation to this matter, as are most women. I feel
specially called to act in this reform when I have gained
wisdom for the task; the world can never be redeemed
till this central relation of life is placed on a truer
footing.

<p>
But I meant to talk to you about the cholera. Our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
physicians confessedly cannot cure it. The Professor
who lectured upon it yesterday commenced: ‘Gentlemen,
I wish I could tell you how to cure the cholera, but
under all modes of treatment the mortality seems to be the
same; however, I will tell you something of the disease,
and what I would do if called to a case.’

The cordial relations with Professor and students
continued. Throughout the examination time the
most friendly interest was felt in my success by my
fellow-students. One of my brothers came on to
Geneva to attend my graduation. Being personally
a stranger to the students, he was much amused by
the free indications of friendly comradeship which he
overheard. The ceremony of conferring the full and
equal diploma of Doctor of Medicine upon a woman
excited much interest in the neighbourhood. It
was held in the large Presbyterian Church, which,
with its ample galleries, was crowded in every part
with spectators. The other students walked in procession
from the college to the church, but I went
up with my brother and took my seat in the side
aisle.

Hurrah,’tis almost over!
</p>

<p>
<i>Tuesday, January 23, 1849.</i>—The day, the grand
day, is nearly finished; and now whilst visitors are dropping
in I must record my first entrance into public life—’twas
bright and beautiful and very gratifying. Great
curiosity was felt. As I entered and sat in the church I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
gave one thought to friends, and then thought only of the
Holy One. After the degree had been conferred on the
others, I was called up alone to the platform. The President,
in full academical costume, rose as I came on the
stage, and, going through the usual formula of a short
Latin address, presented me my diploma. I said: ‘Sir,
I thank you; it shall be the effort of my life, with the help
of the Most High, to shed honour on my diploma.’ The
audience applauded, but their presence was little to me.
I was filled with a sense of the grandeur of a holy life, with
high resolves for the future. As I came down, George
Field opened the door of the front row, and I was much
touched by the graduates making room for me, and insisting
that I should sit with them for the remainder of the
exercises. Most gladly I obeyed the friendly invitation,
feeling more thoroughly at home in the midst of these
true-hearted young men than anywhere else in the town.
I heard little of what was said; my whole soul was absorbed
in heavenly communion. I felt the angels around
me. Dr. Lee gave the valedictory address; he surprised
me by the strong and beautiful way in which he alluded
to the event. I felt encouraged, strengthened to be
greatly good. As I stood at the door the faculty all most
kindly wished me good-bye, and Dr. Hale and Bishop De
Lancy shook hands and congratulated me. All the ladies
collected in the entry, and let me pass between their
ranks; and several spoke to me most kindly.
</p>

<p>
For the next few hours, before I left by train, my
room was thronged by visitors. I was glad of the sudden
conversion thus shown, but my past experience had
given me a useful and permanent lesson at the outset of
life as to the very shallow nature of popularity.

The following letter, written by a younger
brother who came to be with me on this important

occasion, gives some interesting as well as amusing
details of the event:—

</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Beloved Relations.</span>—The important crisis is past,
the great occasion over, the object of so much and
so justifiable anticipation has been attained, and proud
as I always feel of the Blackwells, my familism never
seemed to me so reasonable and so perfectly a matter
of course as it did this morning, when, having escorted
E. into the crowded church and taken my seat beside
her, we learned from the music that the graduating
class, headed by the dean, trustees, faculty, &amp;c., were
marching in solemn conclave into the aisle. I found
E. well and in good spirits, as you may suppose.
Monday morning E. and I went to the college, where
she underwent a second examination, as did also the
other members of the graduating class, from the curators
of the university, no others but themselves, the class,
and the faculty being admitted. From this, as from the
former one, our Sis came off with flying colours and
the reputation of being altogether the leader of the class.
In the afternoon they were successively called upon to
read from their theses, and to this I was admitted; but
Elizabeth’s being in Buffalo to be printed, she could not
be called upon. The Professor and students all seem to
feel most kindly and warmly friendly. While I sat by
the stove on Monday morning at the college whilst the
graduating class were undergoing their examination below,
the other students, scarcely any of them being acquainted
with my personality, conversed freely about matters and
things, and of course about Elizabeth. ‘Well, boys,’ one
would say, ‘our Elib. feels first-rate this morning. Do you
notice how pleased she looks?’ ‘Yes, indeed,’ replied
another, ‘and I think she well may after the examination
she passed yesterday.’ ‘So Lizzie will get her diploma
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
after all,’ said a third. ‘If any member of the class gets
one, <i>she</i> is sure of it,’ said a fourth. Then all agreed that
‘our Elib.’ was ‘a great girl,’ and in short I found that
she was a universal favourite with both professors and
students. Nothing could be more cordial than the former
are, and several are very gentlemanly and intelligent
men indeed, and I formed some pleasant acquaintances
among them.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the Commencement little Dr.
Webster was <i>in his glory</i>; he is a warm supporter of
Elizabeth and likes a fuss, and nothing could exceed
his delight when he found that the whole country round
was sending in large numbers of people, and that all
the ladies of Geneva were turning out <i>en masse</i> to see
a lady receive a medical diploma. At ten o’clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the
students met at the college and marched in procession with
music to the Literary College, where they were headed
by the Bishop of New York, Dr. Hale, the dean, and the
curators, the faculty, &amp;c. Dr. Webster was very anxious
that E. should march in procession, and sent down two
messages to that effect; but E. very properly refused.
About half-past ten o’clock Elizabeth and I walked up
to the church—she was very nicely dressed in her black
brocaded silk gown, <i>invisibly green</i> gloves, black silk
stockings, &amp;c. As we ascended the college steps, Dr.
Webster met Eliz. and again urged the request, whereupon
she told him peremptorily that ‘it wouldn’t be
ladylike.’ ‘Wouldn’t it indeed? Why, no, I forgot—I
suppose it wouldn’t,’ said the little Doctor, evidently
struck for the first time with the idea. So it was arranged
that Eliz. and I should sit down at the entrance of the
left aisle and join the procession as it came up, and we
then walked in and sat down. We found the church, galleries
and all, <i>crowded with ladies</i>, they only having been
as yet admitted; and of course when we came in there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
was a general stir and murmur, and everybody turned
to look at us. By the time the procession came up, all
the pews, except those reserved for students, were filled,
and the gentlemen had to pour in afterwards and take the
aisles, &amp;c. When the procession entered, Mr. Field, a
very pleasant, gentlemanly fellow-graduate, offered his
arm, and all the class took their seats together in front of
the stage. After a short discourse by Dr. Hale, the President,
the diplomas were conferred—four being called up
at a time—and, ascending the steps to the platform, the
President, addressed them in a Latin formula, taking off
his hat, but remaining seated, and so handed them their
diplomas, which they received with a bow and retired.
Elizabeth was left to the last and called up alone. The
President taking off his hat, rose, and addressing her in
the same formula, substituting <i>Domina</i> for <i>Domine</i>, presented
her the diploma, whereupon our Sis, who had
walked up and stood before him with much dignity,
bowed and half turned to retire, but suddenly turning
back replied: ‘Sir, I thank you; by the help of the Most
High it shall be the effort of my life to shed honour upon
your diploma;’ whereupon she bowed and the President
bowed, the audience gave manifestations of applause,
little Dr. Webster rubbed his hands, the learned curators
and faculty nodded grave approbation at each other upon
the platform, and our Sis, descending the steps, took her
seat with her fellow-physicians in front. Now walks up
into the pulpit Professor Lee, with a large manuscript and
a solemn air, and commences his address to the graduates.
It was on the whole good; he gave it pretty strong to
Homœopathists, Hydropathists, Mesmerists, Thompsonians,
&amp;c., and gave the ladies of the audience quite a
lecture for their encouragement and circulation of quack
medicines, informing them that they had better study
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
a little the principles of medicine before attempting to
practise what they were so profoundly ignorant about.
At the close he alluded to the novel proceeding which
they had taken, and the censure or imitation which it
would necessarily create. He justified the proceeding,
and passed a most gratifying and enthusiastic encomium
on the result of the experiment in the case of Eliz. He
pronounced her the <i>leader</i> of her class; stated that she had
passed through a thorough course <i>in every department</i>,
slighting none; that she had profited to the very utmost
by all the advantages of the institution, and by her ladylike
and dignified deportment had proved that the
strongest intellect and nerve and the most untiring perseverance
were compatible with the softest attributes of
feminine delicacy and grace, &amp;c., to all which the students
manifest by decided attempts at applause their
entire concurrence. As the audience passed out the
Bishop came up with Dr. Hale, requested an introduction,
and spoke very pleasantly, congratulating her on
her course, to the great astonishment of the conservatives.
As we walked out of the church we found that almost all
the ladies had stopped outside, and as we appeared,
opened their ranks and let us pass, regarding E. with
very friendly countenances. Most of E.’s time was taken
up till our departure next day at half-past one o’clock in
receiving calls from her few friends.

The admission of a woman for the first time to a
complete medical education and full equality in the
privileges and the responsibilities of the profession
produced a widespread effect in America. The
public press very generally recorded the event, and
expressed a favourable opinion of it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Even in Europe some notice of it was taken, and
‘Punch’ showed his cordial appreciation by his
amusing but friendly verses.<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
</p>

<p>
I knew, however, that a first step only had been
taken. Although popular sanction had been gained
for the innovation, and a full recognised status
secured, yet much more medical experience than I
possessed was needed before the serious responsibilities
of practice could be justly met. Returning,
therefore, to Philadelphia, I endeavoured still to
continue my studies. I was politely received by the
heads of the profession in Philadelphia as a professional
sister, and made the following notes in a
journal of that date:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>March 6.</i>—A morning of great gratification; welcomed
cordially to the university, and afterwards heard
Doctors Jackson, Hodges, Gibson, Chapman, and Horner
lecture. Drs. Lee and Ford were with me, the former
quite in spirits at my reception.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 10.</i>—Heard Dr. Williamson lecture and received
his ticket. Visited the Pennsylvania Hospital,
Dr. Levich showing me over it; admired the gallery with
its alcoves and the excellent ventilation. I heard Professor
Agassiz last night. He has just commenced a course of
lectures on the animal world; his manner was simple
and earnest, and the principle he laid down will render
his course of lectures very interesting if he develop them
fully. I am also rubbing up my French, which may be
very important to me.

<span class="smcap">My dear Mother.</span>—You sent me a dear, good,
welcome letter, and I kiss you heartily for all its affection
and sympathy in my eccentric course. I did not miss
out, either, any of the pious parts, but I do think,
mother mine, that it is a little hard that you will not
believe me when I tell you so seriously that my soul is
doing first-rate. You urge upon me the importance of
religion—why, bless the dear mother, what am I doing
else but living religion all the time? Isn’t it my meat and
my drink to do the good will of God; didn’t I use to sit
in the lecture-room and send up a whole cannonade of
little prayers; and didn’t a whole flood of answers come
straight down from the throne of grace? And what am I
doing now? Do you think I care about medicine? Nay,
verily, it’s just to kill the devil, whom I hate so heartily—that’s
the fact, mother; and if that isn’t forming Christ
in one, the hope of Glory, why, I don’t know what is.
So pray comfort yourself, and have faith that such a
‘child of many prayers’ will be fixed up all straight at
last.... I live in a good society, the fellowship of hard-workers,
for however little the result of my actions may
be, I have the strengthening conviction that my aim is
right, and that I, too, am working after my little fashion
for the redemption of mankind. I agree with you fully in
distrusting the ‘Harbinger,’ and should certainly banish
it from my centre table if I had risen to the dignity of
possessing one. I dislike their discussions, and their way
of discussing some subjects. I think them calculated to
do a great deal of mischief, and am only consoled by the
reflection that few people read them. I go in whole-souledly
for the Divine marriage institution, and shall
always support it by precept, and as soon as I get the
chance by example too, and all those who would upset it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
I consider fools and infidels. I think Associationists too
often a very poor set of people, and if they would
commence by reforming themselves, and let the Almighty
take care of the world, I think they would be much
better employed. As to the infidel French philosophy
you talk of, it is just twaddle, which I should instantly
reject if anybody were to stuff it into me. I am now
longing to be at work abroad, where I might spend my
time much more profitably—but I do want greatly to see
you all again. How long it is since I was at home!—more
than five years, I think. I cannot consent to become a
stranger to the <i>Geschwistern</i>, and W. and E. &amp; E. seem
almost unknown. Good-bye, dear mother. I shall see
you soon, and then you will be able to read me sermons
to your heart’s content.—Your M. D.

I felt, however, keenly the need of much wider
opportunities for study than were open to women in
America. Whilst considering this problem I received
an invitation from one of my cousins, then visiting
America, to return with him to England, and endeavour
to spend some time in European study
before engaging in practice in America. This valuable
offer was joyfully accepted, and I prepared for
a journey to Europe, first of all paying a short farewell
visit to my family in Cincinnati.

STUDY IN EUROPE

1849-1851
</span></h2>


<p>
On April 30 we landed at Liverpool, and I began to
make acquaintance with the wonderful and unknown
Old World, which I had left when a child of eleven.
Everything seemed new and striking. The substantial
character of Liverpool, the ‘finished look’
of the surrounding country, the extraordinary character
of the mining district—all awakened keen
interest. My poor cousin being ill with rheumatism,
however, we journeyed on at once to his home
at Portway Hall, near Dudley. A fortnight was
spent in this pleasant home, which, though in the
centre of the ‘Black Country,’ was surrounded by
gardens where the flowers were fresh and sweet, the
trees in beautiful leaf, whilst the cuckoo saluted us
in the morning and the nightingales at night. I
gained a glimpse of the lovely English country, and
spent a memorable time in examining the novel
surroundings of the great mining district of England.
The following letters are descriptive of a young
student’s impressions on revisiting her native land
more than a generation ago.

<p>
Thanks be to Heaven, I am on land once more, and
never do I wish again to experience that hideous nightmare—a
voyage across the ocean. We had the warmest
welcome at my cousin’s pleasant home.... I went
one afternoon to see the casting—that is, when the melted
iron, like a river of fire, flows into the moulds which
shape it. The Russel Hall Works are close by the town
of Dudley. There is a wide extent of smoky country,
with many little groups of machinery and brick buildings,
each constituting or rather surrounding a pit; many
mounds of glowing coal turning into coke; piles of ironstone
being burned previous to the smelting; the houses
of the managers in various directions, the office at the
entrance; and immediately in front the two great blast-furnaces,
which burn incessantly day and night, making
many thousands of tons a year. Very few workmen
were to be seen, but underground a whole army of them
were hard at work. The casting was very curious. Twice
a day the melted iron is drawn off from the bottom of the
great brick towers they call furnaces. Strong men with
faces as black and scorched as a coal were busy, armed
with iron poles, guiding the sea of fire that rushed out
into the moulds that covered a great extent of ground,
drawing out the white-hot masses of cinders and dirt,
and splashing cold water over the front of the furnace to
enable them to stand there. We remained at the farther
end, but the heat was so great that we had to cover our
faces. Suddenly, with a loud noise, the flames burst out
from the furnaces, ascending to the very top, immense
volumes of black smoke rolled over our heads, and
the rushing noise grew louder and louder. I thought
some accident had occurred, and looked out for the
safest retreat, when I found it was only the clearing of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
the furnaces by sending a powerful blast through them,
which was always practised after a casting. Within
a square of twelve miles one-sixth of the iron used in
the world is said to be made.... I paid a visit to
Dudley Castle, having a great curiosity to see a veritable
old castle, a ruined castle; and I explored every corner,
looked up the broad chimneys, and peeped out of the
stone window frames and loopholes with a feeling of
true antiquarian enthusiasm. We sat down on a stone
bench at the foot of the keep, which is very old, and on
a little hill on the western side of the courtyard; there
we tried to revive the scene as it may have looked
hundreds of years ago, when armed men were bustling
about the court, and visions of fair ladies gleaming from
the upper windows and now ruined terraces. The
castle crowns a wooded hill, commanding the town and
level country for many miles; the remains of a double
wall with a moat between still surround the castle. As
I stood by those strong walls and looked down on the
wide fields below, I began to imagine how grandly an
army would approach, and how noble a defence the
castle would make, till I longed to revive the ancient
conflicts, and almost frightened my companions by my
martial demonstrations and visions of grim warriors
peeping through the iron-barred windows. But the
illusion could not last long; the country is covered with
smoke and coal-pits, the wallflower is smiling on the
ruins of the old castle, and instead of subterranean
dungeons and dark passages the hill is excavated for
limestone; and these artificial caverns of enormous
extent, with a canal winding through them and echoing to
the voices of the workmen, form one of the most curious
features of the place, and show how the same energy and
power are still at work, though in a very different direction.
We drove home through the little town of Dudley, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
presented a most curious spectacle, for it was market
day, and the workmen from all the country round, having
received their wages, were come in with their wives and
children to make their weekly purchases. The streets
were crammed with people, and our carriage made its
way through a living mass that hardly opened to let it
through. I examined the people, as I have constantly
done since I entered the country, with great curiosity.
I could not see one handsome face in the whole
multitude—indeed, the English appear to me a very
common-looking people—but neither was I struck by the
misery I expected to see. In Liverpool I had peered
into all the back alleys and odd corners I could
find; I have done the same in Dudley. There is great
cleanliness observed everywhere, that compares most
favourably with American cities, and the inhabitants of
those districts, though miserable, of course, according to a
true standard of human life, were neither more numerous
nor more wretched than I have been accustomed to see
in America. I have very rarely seen a beggar, and in no
instance one that has particularly excited my compassion.
This district is one of the most thickly peopled in
England, and certainly presents an average view of the
mining districts, and the poor labourers seem far more
comfortable and intelligent than I had supposed. The
manufacturing districts, I have no doubt, would present
a different spectacle. I have had no opportunity of
judging them. I have just learned to my great satisfaction
that Mr. Charles Plevins, an old friend of my
cousin, is going to London for a few days, and will escort
me there and remain during my stay. I can hardly tell
you what a relief this is, for the idea of going to that
great city an entire stranger, and wandering about it
utterly alone, was a most desolate, oppressive thought,
and entirely destroyed all the pleasure of the anticipation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
though I assumed a very independent tone in speaking of
my journey when I found it was utterly impossible for
cousin to accompany me. He is an old friend of cousin’s,
though young—only twenty-five—and there is an air of
youth and immaturity about all his opinions and actions;
but his spirit is so beautiful that you have only to see
in order to love it, so pure and gentle, so true and genial.
In my opinion he belongs to a class of young Englishmen
that I find is large and constantly increasing. Cousin
S. is one of them. They are reformers in spirit, but not
destroyers; they have no clear immediate plan of reform,
and so earnestly maintain the present system until they
find a better one; but they are all the time seeking for
truth, and longing most earnestly to realise that grand
future in which they all believe. Fichte is one of their
favourite teachers; Carlyle, Emerson, Channing, all we
have known and learned from in the past, they worship
now; but they have yet to study Fourier and Swedenborg
before they can reach that strong hope and clear insight
which will make their working strong, happy, and practically
efficient. Now, there is too much of metaphysical
abstraction in their thoughts, their religious faith is not
a glorious reality, and in the case of our friend Charles,
he despises the material world too much, and seeks to
subdue the body and purify the spirit by privations which
proceed from the noblest motive but a mistaken faith.
</p>

<p>
I have a curious interest in seeing and hearing him;
it revives so completely my earlier life, when I thought
as he does now, and strove for the same ends by the
same means. My medical effort won his admiration
before I arrived, and since I came here he has done me
every little service in his power. His family is an old
and highly respected one in Birmingham, and when he
found I wished to see something of medicine in the city
he used his influence to arrange a useful day for me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
Accordingly, the day before yesterday I went in with
him to Birmingham, having received invitations from
several physicians. We spent the day in visiting the
various institutions together, and as it was my first introduction
to the English medical world, and as I consider it
a good omen, I must describe our doings particularly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parker, surgeon to the Queen’s Hospital, had
some difficulty in believing that it was not an ideal being
that was spoken of; but when he found I was really and
truly a living woman he sent me an invitation to witness
the amputation he was going to perform, and promised
to show me all the arrangements of the institution,
sending also a note of admission to the college and
museum. Dr. Evans, a distinguished physician, invited
me to the General Hospital, the largest and oldest one,
and expressed much sympathy in my undertaking. Dr.
McKay, of the Lying-in Hospital, thought that God and
Nature had indicated the unfitness of women for such a
pursuit as I had chosen, but still said he would be very
happy to show the lady all he could. All the students
were on the <i>qui vive</i> to see the lady surgeon, and as we
approached the building I saw them peeping through
doors and windows. Mr. Parker, a fat, rosy-faced John
Bull, received me very politely, introduced me to some
M.D.’s who had come to see the sight, showed me
the arrangements of the hospital, which is young and
not particularly interesting, and then took me to the
operating-room. It was crammed with students, and as
fresh ones arrived they would peep about, whisper to
their neighbours, and then work their way to a place
where they could see me. It was just a repetition of old
scenes; a few minutes’ curiosity, and then all went on as
usual. The students presented the same mixture of faces
as our American ones, wore rather better coats, and
seemed to be quicker in their movements. I noted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
nothing peculiar in the operation, which was skilfully
performed, without chloroform, which Mr. Parker disliked.
Before leaving, he offered me a letter to the
famous Roux of Paris.
</p>

<p>
At the General Hospital, established sixty years,
Dr. Heslop received me with the utmost deference,
showed me every ward, male and female, pointed out
every case of note, let me examine it, and detailed the
treatment, particularly one operation for subclavian
aneurism, which was so remarkable that they were going
to publish the case. Dr. Percy, of Birmingham, a particular
friend of S., has promised to meet me in London,
and to furnish me with all the necessary introduction to
give me an insight into the medical world of the great
metropolis. So I look forward now with great hope to a
short but delightful visit, and leave for London next
Saturday, the 12th, to await my passports, which I shall
probably receive with letters on the 16th, and then off
again for the land of dancing and wooden shoes. I
heard the cuckoo this morning; what a soft human
sound it is! Last night the nightingales were singing
sweetly in the twilight. Our garden is full of lovely
English flowers; the primrose and cowslip, laurustinea,
and many others make our garden beautiful, though the
weather is a most cold, gloomy nurse to the little darlings.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 17.</i>—We left Portway yesterday afternoon. I
parted from our friends with great regret; we were
getting used to one another; a home feeling was growing
up there to me, and so it was time to be off. We arrived
late in London, so I could only remark the many handsome
houses in gardens that marked its environs, the
fine and spacious orderly railway station, the wide streets
and gay shops. This morning, after seeing Dr. Percy,
Cousin S.’s friend, who has promised to give me the
necessary introductions to the hospitals to-morrow, we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
walked about five miles through the city before reaching
Mrs. X.’s house in Devonshire Street. During our walk
we passed through many handsome squares with monuments
and public buildings, not an isolated one, as with
us, but row after row of grand pillared edifices, whole
streets of palaces, substantial, built of freestone, but all
rendered dingy by smoke, which permeates the atmosphere
and penetrates everywhere. The most venerable
pile of Westminster Abbey is crumbling with age; the
cathedral service was being chanted when we entered;
the central space was filled with people. The aisles are
in the form of a cross, bordered by tall pillars rising lofty
and plain to support the long vistas of arches. The
spaces are filled up by a wilderness of monuments, a
subdued light pouring in, a cool, stony atmosphere filling
the cathedral. It is a noble old building, and has impressed
me more than anything I’ve seen. From Westminster
Bridge I saw the new Houses of Parliament—an
immense pile, the ornaments too delicate for its size.
The poor little river was covered with boats, and the
bridge with people enjoying the Sunday; but London was
much quieter than I supposed it would be. I noticed
but one ‘confectionery store’ partly open; the day seemed
to be very strictly observed. We walked through Regent
Street, and through endless rows of handsome houses
constituting the ‘West End,’ to Mrs. X.’s. We were
shown in by a footman in crimson plush breeches, white
stockings, and claret-coloured coat with gold buttons, to
the drawing-rooms—the walls lined with figured crimson
velvet, and all manner of lounges and tables covered
with knick-knackery scattered about. The lady made
her appearance in a blue and black satin dress with jet
ornaments and a lace headdress—a handsome brunette,
with red cheeks and very black eyes and hair, and altogether
too much mannerism to please me. She was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
evidently criticising me, and holding herself in a non-committal
attitude. I sat still and talked very quietly,
thinking to myself that if I were condemned to live there
one week I should overturn the lady and smash everything
to atoms. Presently a few fashionable morning
visitors dropped in to condole with the lady, who had
scratched her throat by swallowing a mouthful too
hastily, and so was an <i>invalid</i>; some messages of inquiry
and condolence were delivered by an old, grave footman,
so very silly, and answered in so absurd a manner, that I
wondered how the man could keep a grave countenance;
and yet the lady had wit and spirit which occasionally
flashed out. Sir J. H. came in with Dr. H. to see me.
I had a little very pleasant talk, and am to meet him on
Tuesday. We descended to lunch, ladies sitting down in
their bonnets. The dining-room and library had ceilings
beautifully painted to imitate the sky with clouds; the
whole house was hung with paintings. The lady’s
manner grew gradually pleasanter; she seemed to like
me, admired my hand, and insisted on my drinking a
glass of wine—the first I ever took. I told her so, and
she was much pleased at her influence. She took us in
her barouche through Regent’s Park, and then extended
her drive to Hyde Park. These parks are very beautiful—miles
of grassy lawn, scattered over with groves, gardens,
and clumps of trees, with occasional water, and varied
with little valleys. They are surrounded by rows of
palace houses, sometimes approaching the carriage road,
sometimes lost in gardens and shrubbery. I did enjoy
to see the people walking about, sitting under the trees,
inhaling a little fresh air on the quiet Sunday, for the
most perfect order prevailed. Our hostess became quite
agreeable, laughed, and chatted merrily about all manner
of nothings. It was impossible to converse with her;
she must do the talking with a little support, and she gave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
forth a good deal of shrewd worldly wisdom. She set us
down at the Zoological Gardens in Regent’s Park, with
many regrets that an engagement to a dinner-party in the
country prevented her asking me home, and the expression
of a strong desire to have a long, full conversation.
</p>

<p>
<i>Monday, May 1849.</i>—This morning I called on Dr. Carpenter,
who has written those admirable works on physiology.
He lives near Regent’s Park; it was sparkling
with dew as I walked through—refreshingly sweet.
I found him and his wife exceedingly agreeable. I liked
them at once. They questioned me with great interest
about my past course. I am to meet some distinguished
people at their house to-night, and among them a Miss
Gillies, an artist who has watched my steps with the
highest pleasure, and who thinks the only true livers
are the workers. I received several notes of introduction
from Dr. C. He says I must hear Mr. Paget
lecture; that he is the most promising surgeon in England.
I found an invitation to a pharmaceutical <i>soirée</i>
awaiting me on my return, with the information that I
might see all the distinguished M.D.’s there assembled.
</p>

<p>
<i>Evening.</i>—I have just returned from Dr. C.’s delightful
little party. The ladies were in regular ball costume;
some dresses very elegant; dancing to the piano; music,
vocal and instrumental. Dr. C. gave us a very beautiful
piece of Mendelssohn’s on the organ; he and his wife
sang together with great feeling. His microscopes, said
to be the most beautiful in England, were there. His
preparations were exquisite: the lung of a frog most
minutely injected, a piece of shark skin which seems
covered with innumerable teeth, and piles of other specimens.
Miss Gillies is a distinguished artist. I am to
visit her and see her relation, Dr. Southwood Smith.
Chapman, the well-known publisher, was present, and
talked a good deal to me, but seemed a little undecided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
what tone to take. He has a very handsome, intellectual
face. I was introduced to many pleasant people; one
had the rare, beautiful face of Cowper’s mother. Great
interest seemed to be felt in my course.
</p>

<p>
Before going to Dr. C.’s I went to examine the
specimens collected for the pharmaceutical <i>soirée</i>. I
was surprised to find that the <i>papier-mâché</i> models have
been hitherto unknown in England, and that the people
were regarding with the utmost rapture specimens which
are in common use in all American colleges. Sir
J. H. drove us to the Consumption Hospital and the
Chelsea Botanical Gardens—a most kind-hearted, simple-mannered
old gentleman....
</p>

<p>
Dr. Percy secured me a great treat. I visited the
Hunterian Museum in company with Mr. Owen, who
lectures at the institution. It is said to be the finest
collection of comparative and morbid anatomy in the
world. Mr. Owen is a man of genius, and the hour
passed away like a minute while listening to his eloquent
descriptions of the fossil remains and the laws which related
them to living animals, to man, and to the globe. He
invited me to come any morning between ten and twelve,
but unfortunately my time is too crowded. The obstetric
collection is very fine; if I return through London I
shall certainly try to spend a week or two in examining it.
</p>

<p>
We next took the railroad and went to Greenwich,
choosing the third-class open cars that I might see the
country, which is laid out in market gardens richly cultivated,
all round London, though the city, stretching out
through Deptford to Greenwich, makes one uninterrupted
town in that direction. Greenwich Hospital for Sailors
has impressed me more than any other institution with
the power and wealth of the nation. It is a series of
great palaces, connected by colonnades with double rows
of pillars ranged round a large green open to the river,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
with the park and observatory in the background. The
old sailors were hobbling about in comfortable dresses,
with enormous rations of bread and meat; for we
reached it just at dinner-time, and they were allowed to
take their meals and eat in their cabins. There are long
walks where they smoke, and they rove about in the
freest style. Their chapel is a very beautiful hall,
though I fear the rich painting and mosaic is lost on the
rough tars. The Painted Hall is immediately opposite;
the vaulted ceiling is covered with figures which are
larger than life, even from below; the walls are entirely
covered with large paintings, richly framed, of naval
engagements and naval heroes, and many relics of the
great commanders are preserved in cases. The park is
always open to the public; groups of women and children
were sitting under the fine old trees, and the deer
were so tame that they took no notice of passers-by.
We sailed up the river to Waterloo Bridge, passing the
Tower and St. Paul’s, and several handsome stone
bridges. Then we went over the British Museum, which
is thrown open to the public. We had only time to pass
rapidly through hall after hall devoted to branches of
natural science, Egyptian monuments, Grecian remains,
&amp;c., all admirably classified, with a label to every specimen.
How I longed that our students, and particularly
a certain E. B., could enjoy the great advantage of walking
to such an institution, and seeing each object of
study actually there in its natural relations! I hastened
home to wash and dress, and reached Mrs. X.’s just in
time for the seven o’clock dinner. It was a tremendous
operation. We sat at table for three hours. I really
grew stiff, notwithstanding the champagne I drank. By-the-by,
that is the only wine I like; iced champagne is
really good. I sat by Sir J. H. at table, and never
discovered till I had left that it was actually mother’s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
old friend. He told Charles that he knew my mother,
and remembered my face perfectly, having often seen me
at church. I regretted exceedingly that I did not know
the connection till too late, for I had always liked the
kind old gentleman, and he would have seemed to me
quite like an old friend. He has been rather unfortunate
in money matters lately, and was robbed of all his family
jewels by a foreign count and countess whom he was
hospitably entertaining. He possesses an old château in
France, which he often visits, and gave me his card to use
at Boulogne, in case I went that way. The general conversation,
however, was stupid, and I really needed our three-mile
walk home to wear off its constraining effects.
</p>

<p>
Thursday morning I visited my first hospital, St.
Thomas’s, but under rather unpleasant circumstances;
indeed, I hesitated whether to go at all. The surgeon to
whom I sent my letter of introduction knew nothing
about me, thought it was a very indelicate undertaking,
and simply sent me a line to one of the nurses, with the
request that I would not enter any of the men’s wards.
I swallowed the indignity, however, and went, feeling
very uncomfortable. But to my surprise, after I had
been there a little while I was met by Mr. South, the
senior surgeon, who had come on purpose to meet me
and show me everything—a very kind, rather eccentric
man, who paid me the utmost attention, and pointed out
everything, even to the everlasting brewhouse of the
establishment. In the museum he drew my attention to
many noteworthy specimens, such as the aorta tied by
Sir Astley Cooper. St. Thomas’s is a series of enormous
buildings, which is the character of most public institutions
here; its income is 30,000<i>l.</i> per annum, and some
hospitals have even more. Then he invited me to attend
his clinical lecture; so at the head of a large body of
students, who had been peeping at me in every direction,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
I passed with him through ward after ward, men’s and
women’s, the students preserving the most perfect order,
though I could see that they were filled with the intensest
curiosity. He gave me the fullest description of
interesting cases, and made me examine several. He
left his students to the house-surgeon, and accompanied
me to the Barclay Brewery—an enormous affair, quite a
national curiosity. It was here that the brutal Haynau,
whilst visiting the place a short time ago, was mobbed
by the men when they heard who had come amongst
them, and barely escaped some very rough usage. My
courteous escort left me in the kindliest manner, promising
me an introduction to the Bethlehem. While at
St. Thomas’s I received three invitations to <i>post-mortems</i>,
to a lecture, and to the Ophthalmic Dispensary, all of
which I was compelled to decline for want of time.
</p>

<p>
At the brewery visitors enter their names. I set
mine down without the M.D.; Mr. South insisted on
my adding it. I have been asked by physicians again
and again if they shall call me doctor—they fully recognise
my right. I always answer this question in the
affirmative, as a matter of principle. I can hardly describe
to you the difference of feeling with which I
entered and left the hospital. We walked a couple of
miles to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Charles T., an elegant
household, though without the fetters of fashion;
they welcomed me most kindly. My two remaining days
will be very busy: I have two or three hospitals to visit
and several people to see; indeed, engagement treads
upon engagement, so that I’ve hardly a moment to think.
I thought such excitement would have bothered me intensely.
It did at first bewilder, but now I’ve roused myself
to meet it and I really enjoy it. I’ve never had such
an experience; I must have walked ten miles a day. I
come home sometimes hardly able to move a foot; I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
wash and dress, and in an hour I’m up again and fresh
for as much more—the more I have to do, the more I can.
I believe I’ve never yet begun to call out my power of
working.
</p>

<p>
The girl has just come in with my letters, passport,
and papers by the ‘Europa’—what a good sight! Bless
you all ten thousand times! My next letter will probably
be from Paris....
</p>

<p>
... I have had a delightful visit to Hampstead, where
Dr. Wilkinson lives. He received me at once with the
greatest kindness and interest, introduced me to his wife,
a very sweet woman, graceful and gentle, and to some
very pretty black-eyed children. He was disappointed
that my stay was so short; told me I ought certainly to
spend a year in London, that the longer he lived in it the
more wonderful it seemed to him, that every idea was
represented there not by a single individual but by a
whole class, and that the societies I might study there
would be of great service to me as a means of development.
He is a tall, strong man, not handsome, wears
spectacles, and has a strong expression of goodness in his
face. He took me to see two people who were desirous
of making my acquaintance, and showed me all the fine
points of view from Hampstead, which truly is a most
lovely spot, though only two miles from London. It is a
hilly range, looking down on wide undulating country on
both sides, with blue hills in the distance—Windsor
Castle being distinctly visible twenty miles off. I cannot
describe the place; it seems to have built itself in one of
Nature’s choicest nooks. There is a common covered
with golden gorse, broken by little dells in which pretty
cottages are nestled, and there are old mansions hidden
in noble parks, old walls covered with luxuriant ivy,
shady lanes with long avenues of trees and smooth
hedges of hawthorn and laurel, fields covered with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
rich carpet golden with buttercups and daisies, the cows
quietly feeding in a veritable paradise to them. Then
there are all manner of odd corners and irregular clusters
of houses, but everywhere the most intense vegetation.
The little cottage occupied by Byron, who used often to
resort to this lovely spot, was pointed out to me, and
Harrow, where he went to school. We had much interesting
conversation. In the omnibus I parted from the
doctor with real regret, but quite refreshed by the cordial
intercourse.

<p>
<i>Journey to Paris.</i>—All my teachers and medical
friends in America had strongly advised my going to
Paris, as the one place where I should be able to
find unlimited opportunities for study in any branch
of the medical art. Being then desirous of pursuing
surgery as well as medicine, I followed their advice.
On May 21, 1849, with a very slender purse and
few introductions of any value, I found myself in the
unknown world of Paris, bent upon the one object
of pursuing my studies, with no idea of the fierce
political passions then smouldering amongst the
people, nor with any fear of the cholera which was
then threatening an epidemic.
</p>

<p>
Curious glimpses of this outer world are given in
letters sent home at that time.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
Paris, 11 Rue de Seine: May 1849.
</p>

<p>
You see, dear friends, that I have reached my destination
at last, and fairly established myself in this strange
city. I parted from my kind companion, who in London
had spent the whole week in one continued effort to aid
me in every possible way, with real gratitude. I could
not thank him, words seemed too meaningless.... I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
left London with the profoundest respect for the vast
power of many kinds displayed there, and a grateful
remembrance of a personal reception that had been so
encouraging. It rained the whole way over. An English
lady returning to Paris with her husband was very
friendly. She promised to show me the best place to
stay at in Calais, and said if I would travel with them in
the cars she could give me much information about
Paris, for the French made a point of cheating the
English unmercifully, thinking they were immensely
wealthy. We were notified of our approach to Calais by
a strong smell of fish. It was quite dark and raining in
torrents; I was very glad to have companions. We
picked our way as well as we could over the stone pier,
enclosed by walls on which stood a lighthouse glaring
into the dark night. We stepped into the rooms where
the passports are examined, and there the whiskered
faces showed me I was amongst strangers, and the <i>Où
allez-vous, madame?</i> confirmed the fact. Next morning
I stood for some time on the pier waiting for the Custom-house
officer and watching the strange people. Market-women
in their white caps (the common people wear no
bonnet), groups of workmen in blue blouses, fishwomen
of enormous muscular development, though short, returning
from fishing laden with their nets, clad in a single
petticoat scarcely reaching to the knee, little children
with their school-books making sundry excursions on to
the fishing-smacks by the way, and chattering French
with all their might. At the Custom-house the search
was very slight; they did not even see the cases which I
had put at the back of a larger trunk, and I was only
charged a couple of francs. We left Calais at nine o’clock,
and the difference between France and England was
apparent the whole way. The country was no flatter
than between Liverpool and Birmingham, but badly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
drained and badly cultivated, with many peat bogs and
dwarf willows bordering the watercourses. There were
many villages built of light-coloured stone, but apparently
not one brisk, thriving town. The whole way wooden
fences instead of beautiful live hedges, women digging
trenches and working in the peat bogs, and the railroad
left in the rough, unfinished style of America, without the
excuse of an immense young country. At the Custom-house
in Paris, where they search the trunks for butter
and cheese, I parted from my travelling companions and
launched boldly into the sea of Paris. It looked very odd
as I drove along; the streets so narrow, with such odd,
old-fashioned houses, all built of this light-coloured stone,
which has no sort of expression. They charged extravagantly
at the hotel where I passed the night, so I
determined at once to procure lodgings, and set off early
next morning to hunt up Mr. Doherty, who I knew
through Dr. Wilkinson would tell me the right quarter
for medical doings.
</p>

<p>
I started off with a map in my hand and hope in my
heart, and reached Mr. Doherty’s house very early, I
suppose, for Parisian hours, for the gentleman was in bed
when my letters were handed in; and soon after a short
sleepy-looking man made his appearance, with a horrid
coarse beard, a blue and red woollen dressing-gown, and
green baize trousers hanging about his ankles. I had
some difficulty in making him comprehend that I was
not Anna. At last, however, with the help of letters and
my explanations, all became clear. I found him very
pleasant; he breakfasted, dressed, &amp;c., while I talked to
his brother Thomas, who is a beautiful artist. Mr. D.
went with me to some places he knew of. At last we
found a little room with bedroom attached in a central
situation and at a moderate rent. The hostess was a very
pleasant-looking woman, with her own room close by, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
whole suite being separated from the rest of the house.
I felt, however, quite disappointed in the city; it did not
seem to me handsome, gay, or elegant after London; but
then, in truth, I was so busy settling my own little
matters that I hardly had time to examine closely. To-day
I have spent in walking about the city with my
hostess, chiefly for the sake of chattering with her and
accustoming my ear to the strange sounds, for I find I
have much to learn. I have great trouble in expressing
myself with any elegance, and I cannot see the physicians
until I have acquired a tolerable command of
words; I shall very soon, however, be able to do so. I
went out to buy a bonnet to-day, but found that my
unfortunate organs were totally unable to squeeze themselves
into a Parisian head-dress; so I was obliged to
order a bonnet, choosing plain grey silk, although I was
assured again and again that nobody wore that colour....

<i>An interview with Lamartine.</i>—At this period
much sympathy was felt in America for the Republican
movement in France, of which Lamartine was
the head. Before leaving Philadelphia a friend had
asked me to be the bearer of one of those expressions
of sympathy from public meetings which were then
sent to the poet from all parts of the United States.
I willingly undertook the commission, and now
wrote to the President for permission to present the
document entrusted to me.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
May 31, 1849.
</p>

<p>
I have just returned from my visit by appointment to
Lamartine, where I went to deliver the Philadelphia
resolution entrusted to me. I must hasten to give you
a sketch before this post—the last—closes.
</p>

<p>
Of course I dressed with great care, and arrived just
at the appointed hour. I was asked if I was a lady from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
America, for Lamartine is to most people <i>in the country</i>.
I was shown through several ante-chambers into a drawing-room,
where stood the poet entertaining some visitors;
he bowed, requested me to wait a few moments, and
withdrew with his visitors into another room. I examined
the apartment: a lofty room, carved and richly gilded,
three long windows opening on to a balcony commanding
a garden full of trees. The room contained a rich carpet
and purple velvet couches and chairs, some portraits, an
exquisite female profile in bas-relief, a golden chandelier
from the ceiling, some antique vases, &amp;c., and a soft
green light from the trees of the large garden diffused
through the room. The door opened and Lamartine
entered; very tall and slender, but the most graceful man
I have ever seen, every movement was music; grey eyes
and hair. The little bust is a pretty good likeness. He
has the gentlemanly voice (Uncle Charles’s), clear, melodious,
perfectly well-bred. In fact, his exterior harmonised
perfectly with his poetry. He understood English.
Slowly and distinctly I explained the commission which
had been entrusted to me. He asked me if the resolution
referred to the fraternity of the race, and seemed to
understand at once the whole matter when I replied in
the affirmative. I referred him to the letters accompanying
the resolution for full explanation respecting the
document and the manner of presenting it. He said he
was very happy to receive these expressions of sympathy.
He would read the letters carefully and send me an
answer, which I promised to transmit to America. He
accompanied me very politely to the stairs, bowed, and
we parted. I was in no way disappointed; there was
perfect harmony in the man and his surroundings.
Doubtless he is a true man, though unable to work into
practice the great thoughts he cherishes.
</p>

<p>
I went last night with my good little hostess to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
neighbouring church, where there is service every evening.
It was well lighted round the central altar, but in
every direction the lofty aisles stretched away into the
darkness, with an occasional lamp illuminating some
saint, and small groups of dark figures kneeling on the
pavement. The people were assembled in the centre—mostly
the lower classes, women in their white caps, and
little children dressed like miniature women; they knelt
or stood, or sat on chairs and benches as the service
required, generally with the utmost devotion. The little
children used the holy water, crossed themselves, and
knelt with their mothers, and regarded the bright lights,
the flowers round the golden Virgin, and the impressive
music with eager, wondering faces. The service was
sung or chanted entirely in Latin; occasionally a pause in
the music would be broken by the sudden, deep tones of
a man’s voice away in the darkness, or a choir of boys’
voices would burst forth apparently from the clouds.
The walls were covered with enormous pictures partially
illuminated. I felt fully the impressiveness of this scene
to the uneducated people; no thought awakened, but the
emotional religious sentiment powerfully addressed; and
this every night, when the solemn ceremonial contrasts so
strongly and soothingly with the traffic of the day. The
children are nursed in this atmosphere until it becomes
a part of their nature that no reasoning can ever change.

My first introduction to Paris institutions was
through the visit of a public official, who brought a
registration paper to be filled up. I put myself down
as <i>Etudiante</i>. The man stared, and then standing
in front of me began to make the most extraordinary
grimaces, opening his eyes until the whites showed
all round them. My first astonished thought was—‘You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
ugly little brute, what on earth are you doing
that for?’ when, his manner suddenly changing on
my look of astonishment, he tapped me benevolently
on the shoulder, saying, ‘<i>Mon enfant</i>, you must not
put yourself down as student—<i>rentière</i> is the word
you must use!’
</p>

<p>
In later life, with larger experience, I came to
the conclusion that I had been interviewed by the
Police des Mœurs! Fortunately at that time I knew
nothing of the corrupt system of accepting and
regulating female vice.
</p>

<p>
My next important interview was of a very
different character. A Boston friend had procured
for me, from a physician, an introduction to the
famous Louis, then at the height of his reputation.
It was a sealed introduction, which I forwarded
with my card. The next day a tall, imposing-looking
gentleman called upon me, who proved to be Louis
himself. I soon felt instinctively that his visit was
one of inspection. I told him frankly of my earnest
desire for hospital and practical instruction. After
a long conversation he most strongly advised me to
enter La Maternité, where in one most important
branch I could in a short time obtain more valuable
practical knowledge than could be obtained anywhere
else, and he informed me of the steps to be
taken in order to obtain admission. Before leaving,
however, M. Louis handed to me the letter of introduction
which I had sent to him, saying that he
thought I ought to see it. It was an astounding
production, written in such wretched French that I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
could only suppose that its author was unaware
of its insulting character, or of the effect that such a
letter delivered to a French gentleman by a young
unknown woman was likely to produce. I never
again presented a sealed letter of introduction.
Some years later, when the distinguished physician
who had sent it called upon me in New York, I
returned the letter to him, with a few words of very
serious remonstrance.
</p>

<p>
On June 1 one of my sisters and a friend came
to Paris, and we moved into pleasant lodgings in the
Rue de Fleurus overlooking the Luxembourg Garden.
Whilst there I attended lectures at the Collège de
France and the Jardin des Plantes, and earnestly
sought for admission to some of the hospitals for
practical instruction. It seemed, however, that an
entrance into La Maternité would be the most
direct first step in obtaining the practical instruction
needed, and although regretting the delay in my
surgical studies which would be involved in such a
course, I finally resolved to pursue the courses of
that great institution.
</p>

<p>
The following letters refer to this period of effort.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin.</span>—I find that I cannot enter the
Maternité at present for want of an <i>acte de naissance</i>. I
am trying to get over the difficulty, but French regulations
are so strict that it is still uncertain whether I can
succeed. Would it be possible to secure in Bristol a
copy of my register of baptism, with a statement of my
birthday and my parents, certified by the mayor or some
proper authority? I was baptised at Bridge Street by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
Mr. Leifchild; I was born on February 3, 1821. I do
not know, however, whether such a register is kept in
England. If it could be procured, it would remove the
difficulty which lies in my way.
</p>

<p>
We find Paris a very lively residence; every day something
new is occurring, or we discover some wonderful
old place which we must certainly visit. One day it is
the funeral celebrations of Marshal Bugeaud, at which
all the great men assist, with an army of soldiers and an
enormous crowd; or a thousand little girls take their first
communion at St. Sulpice, dressed in white with long
veils; or some grand collection of flowers or manufactured
articles calls out the spectacle-loving people. There
is a constant effervescence of life in this great city, which
concentrates all its energy in itself, and makes the
Parisians at the same time the most brilliant and the
most conceited people in the world. The greatest pleasure
which we have yet enjoyed was our trip last Sunday
to Versailles; it is really a place to be proud of, and I
could not wonder at the worship which is paid to that
beautiful temple by the people who, day after day, range
freely through its grand galleries and spacious gardens.
</p>

<p>
I received to-day a very pleasant letter from Dr.
Webster, one of our professors at Geneva; I was much
gratified to find that their course to me has been approved
by the profession in America. It would have grieved me
inexpressibly if they had been condemned for the aid
they had given me, and there seemed to be some possibility
of it when I left. But he tells me my thesis was commented
on in the Report on Medicine at the National
Medical Convention held in Boston, and their course in
relation to me justified and approved. The thesis was
received with applause. This information is quite a relief
to me, for the thought would be too painful that you
could injure your friends.

June 15.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,—By the first of July, as soon as I
have conquered some miserable little difficulties, such as
the <i>acte de naissance</i>, certificate of vaccination, &amp;c.,
which I cannot produce, I shall enter La Maternité, a
world-famous institution, and remain until I have succeeded
in my first object—viz. to become an accomplished
obstetrician. There are personal objections connected
with this course that I was not prepared for—viz. a strict
imprisonment, very poor lodging and food, some rather
menial services, and the loss of three or four nights’ sleep
every week. Still, these are things that can be borne (if
the health will stand them) when the end to be gained is
an important one; and I am sure you will agree with
me that it is wise to sacrifice physical comfort for a
while in order to attain it. I propose to remain there
three months, and then I shall try and accomplish my
second object—viz. surgery.
</p>

<p>
I hope in a day or two to receive permission from
the Directeur-General, M. Davenne, to examine all the
hospitals of Paris. I am working on gradually; but I
find more clearly every day that the genius of the French
nation does not suit me, and my love for the Anglo-Saxon
race, and my admiration for our wonderful Fatherland,
increase by the comparison....
</p>

<p>
We have had a strange glimpse of a revolution, a sort
of theatrical representation of what that terrible thing
might be. I confess that the whole exhibition seemed
to me peculiarly French; and yet there are noble and
terrible passions, lying below this mercurial excitability,
that command hearty sympathy or serious consideration,
and the unjust, tyrannical acts of the Government excite
one’s strongest indignation. Now all is quiet again, however,
and the whole affair is said to have been planned
by the authorities to get rid of certain troublesome men.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
</p>


<p>
A. and E. have stood the shock well, though they
turned quite pale on finding as they were quietly parading
the streets that they were in the midst of an <i>émeute</i>, and
later I was sent out to see if they had not better instantly
return to England, before civil war broke out and their
throats were cut....
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the 13th E. and I went out to
see the curious sight. The Quai to the National Assembly,
more than a mile long, was lined with soldiers with their
drawn bayonets. The Louvre and the Tuileries opposite
were closed and filled with soldiers. An army of cavalry
was mounted and ready to start at any moment. We
passed through hurrying crowds full of excitement, hearing
fearful reports of what had happened and what was to
come. On the bridges, at the corners of the streets, were
large groups of blouses, students, citizens, women, listening
to some orator of the moment, gesticulating violently.
More than once I observed a woman enthusiastically
haranguing an audience. The most curious mixture of
passions was visible on the faces—fear, anger, indignation,
hope, hatred; there was many a figure that realised the
horrors of an earlier revolution. It seems inconceivable
now that those violent expressions should have died
away, and that Paris is going on in its usual busy way.

June 1849.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Friends, one and all</span>,—I closed my last letter
apparently on the eve of a great insurrection. I went
out with E. G. quickly to put it in the post, not knowing
how soon we might be prisoners in the house or stirring
out at the risk of life. We passed through hurrying
crowds full of excitement. Through the night heavy
waggons of ammunition and provisions, escorted by
soldiers, had rumbled through the streets. The public
squares were shut and filled with soldiers. The Democratic
press was destroyed; and the next morning the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
city was declared in a state of siege, and a proclamation
was published by the President calling on all good citizens
to maintain the authority of the law.
</p>

<p>
But nothing occurred, the commotion subsided, and
the Conservative press congratulated the country on its
preservation from the dangerous conspiracy of a few
seditious demagogues.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to get at the truth in a country where
everybody lies upon principle; but it is now commonly
believed that the whole affair was a trick of the Government
to get rid of Ledru Rollin, Considérant, and other
troublesome members of the Montagne, who were determined
to call the President to account for his infamous
conduct to the poor Romans.
</p>

<p>
I do not know whether American papers give these
particulars—you must tell me if I repeat what you can
get better elsewhere—but we have taken deep interest in
these events passing round us. Our indignation is much
roused against the Conservative tyranny; and the belief
in the Government trick shows, curiously enough, of
what it may be capable.
</p>

<p>
A manifestation meeting was called, to support by
general feeling the attack which had been made by the
advanced party in the Assembly on the unconstitutional
measures of the President in suppressing popular gatherings.
Two hundred thousand men were passing quietly
to the place of meeting, some of the most respectable
and distinguished citizens of Paris amongst them, not
the slightest disturbance, not even one ‘Vive la Constitution!’
was heard; but a proclamation had been stuck
about the streets, of the most inflammatory character, calling
the citizens to arms, and signed by Considérant and
Ledru Rollin. On the strength of that proclamation,
which is fully believed to have been a forgery, the ‘meeting’
was dispersed and proceedings instituted against the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
members. The Government is proceeding with a high
hand. I see that to-day even the Conservative press is
putting in a feeble protest.
</p>

<p>
You would be amused to see how universally politics
are discussed: the boy who arranged our rooms, the
market-women at their stalls, everyone finds time to read
a journal and give some opinion about it.

<p>
On June 30 I entered La Maternité; my residence
there was an invaluable one at that stage
of the medical campaign, when no hospitals, dispensaries,
or practical <i>cliniques</i> were open to
women. La Maternité was a great State institution,
where young women to be trained as midwives
were sent up from every department of France.
The system of instruction, both theoretical and
practical, was a remarkable illustration of that
genius for organisation which belongs to the French.
Every moment of time was appropriated; no distraction
of books, newspapers, or other than medical
works were allowed; lectures, wardwork, drills, and
<i>cliniques</i> were arranged from morning to night with
no confusion, but no pause; and the comprehension
and progress of each pupil was constantly tested by
examination.
</p>

<p>
The institution occupied the old convent of Port
Royal, and the discipline was monastic in simplicity,
regularity, and seclusion.
</p>

<p>
Stirring events were occurring in Paris during
my residence in the Maternité, but only vague
rumours reached us, as no newspapers were allowed
within the old grey convent walls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>

<p>
The following letters give curious pictures of life
in this remarkable French institution.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
July 1, 1849: à la Maternité.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,—I have now entered upon a strange
phase of life, which I must try and describe, that you
may imagine me running about in my great white apron,
in which respectable article of apparel I expect to figure
for the next three months. I had a good many obstacles
to encounter from my ignorance of French customs;
and the physicians of Paris, as far as I can judge, are
determined not to grant the slightest favour to a feminine
M.D. I could not obtain from any persons connected
with the Maternité the smallest modification to
suit the very different status with which I enter from
the young French <i>sages-femmes</i>; but I was determined
to enter on whatever conditions, and enter, too, by the
first of July, to habituate myself a little to the ways of
the place before the annual lectures commenced. I find
now that nothing would have been easier than to have
given me a little room to myself, permission to go out
occasionally, and similar favours, which need have occasioned
no jealousy or inconvenience; for the very fact
of my being a foreigner impresses the French girls, and
they would freely have accepted any claim made for me.
But everything was obstinately refused to all the representations
of myself or the Consul, Mr. Walsh, and I
was only too glad to enter as a young, ignorant French
girl. On June 30 I drove down with Anna to the
hospital. A high stone wall, with the tops of old buildings
peeping above, extends nearly the whole length of
a little street. A very small door led into a dark little
entrance, the <i>portière</i> on one side, and a long room,
called by courtesy the <i>parloir</i>, on the other. You must
notice the <i>parloir</i>, for it is there I shall receive my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
visitors, if I ever have any, at two o’clock, in common
with the other <i>élèves</i>; and there in one corner, in a sort
of little glass box, sits the good dame who attends to the
letters and transacts all the outdoor business for the
<i>élèves</i>. The ceiling is very low, the floor of brick, rows
of wooden benches ranged one before the other—the
most uninteresting room you can possibly conceive; the
only pretty thing being the vine leaves which peep
through the diamond-shaped windows. This room forms
part of a row of old buildings standing against the wall,
which contain the director’s bureau, the <i>Interne’s</i> rooms,
&amp;c. It was too late for me to see M. Boivin, the director,
so an old woman took me into the central buildings,
through a labyrinth of little passages and long galleries,
and all manner of rooms and queer places, to Madame
Charrier, the <i>sage-femme</i> in chief, who has her own
rooms in a particular part of the building. Her parlour
is the funniest little cabinet of curiosities, with a carpet
on the floor, as it is of brick instead of waxed wood.
Little chintz sofas, mosaic tables, boxes, china and
figures, crucifixes, pictures and embroideries, and curtains
everywhere. Madame Charrier is a little deformed
woman, elderly, but with a fresh colour still, and kind
blue eyes. I like what I have seen of her; she seems
generally loved by the pupils, and though I do not
imagine her of any particular amount of intellect, she
seems to have good sense, and after twelve years in such
an establishment as this she ought to have much valuable
experience. Madame Charrier conducted me by
unknown ways to Madame Blockel, the superintendent
of the <i>dortoirs</i>, who took me into the infirmary, and
said I must sleep there until I had arranged my affairs
with the director. I did not much admire the idea of
passing the night in the infirmary. There was a large
wood fire on the hearth, and the air felt warm and somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
close. I looked suspiciously at the long rows of
beds extending on each side, their white curtains closely
drawn; I did not know what undesirable emanations
might be proceeding from them. However, I said
nothing, but determined to investigate the contents of
the beds as soon as the observers had withdrawn. My
trunk was brought up, my bed pointed out, a little lamp
placed on the table, and I was left alone. I proceeded
then to make my observations, and found to my great
relief that every bed was empty, except one, in which
one of the <i>élèves</i>, who happened to have a headache, was
lying, and from her I found that the place is healthy and
no epidemic has prevailed there for a long time. I found
her, like all the other French girls, full of those light
kindnesses which are so pleasant. She asked me eagerly
if I was from her province, and seemed to regard me
with much interest when she found I was a stranger
from New York, which was the only part of the United
States she had heard of, and which she took to be an
island near Havannah. I have since found that the
pupils are much disappointed that I am not black, as they
supposed all persons from America were! After talking
a little with her I took out my writing materials, and sat
down to the table determining to pay a little visit across
the water before going to rest in my new home; but
I had no sooner seated myself than Madame Charrier
entered with a crowd of <i>élèves</i>, to know if I would pass
the night in the <i>salle d’accouchements</i>, it being an optional
matter the first night. Of course I expressed the utmost
willingness. I put up my letter with a sigh, dressed myself
for duty, and accompanied an <i>ancienne élève</i> (that
is, one who has already studied a year, and who always
has one or more of the <i>nouvelles élèves</i> under her care for
initiation) to the room where the children are born. A
large apron of coarse towelling was given me, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
injunction not to lose it, or I should have to pay three
francs. It was a large upper room, rather dimly lighted,
beds all round, a fire on the hearth, cupboards full of
linen in the corners, heaps of shining copper and tin
utensils, several rush-bottomed chairs and wooden tables,
and in the centre a large wooden stand with sides, on
which the little new-comers, tightly swathed and ticketed,
are ranged side by side. In the course of the night
we had the pleasure of arranging <i>eight</i> in this way,
and the next morning when Madame Charrier made her
appearance the cloth was removed and the sight shown
with much triumph. It was really very droll. Each
little shapeless red visage peeped from under a coarse
peaked cap, on the front of which was a large label with
the name and sex; a black serge jacket with a white
handkerchief pinned across, and a small blanket tightly
folded round the rest of the body, completed the appearance
of the little mummy. Their behaviour certainly
realised Fourier’s supposition, for there was very little
crying all the time they lay there together. There were
four young French girls sitting up with me, besides the
girl who makes the beds and does the roughest work.
They were all pretty and pleasant, of no education except
their studies in the institution; but those had been evidently
carefully attended to, and it sounded not a little
droll to hear the scientific terms flowing so glibly from
their laughing lips, which were busily employed in talking
nonsense all the time that their duties did not call
them to the bedside. The next morning at ten o’clock
we were discharged from duty; it was Sunday, a comparatively
leisure day, and I being a Protestant was
excused from the religious services, but I was too sleepy
to do much. I wrote, walked in the garden and read a
little there, retired early, and had a most welcome sleep
and very pleasant dreams.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
</p>


<p>
Our <i>dortoir</i> is a large airy room, with a row of
windows and beds on each side, divided into two by a
large archway; it contains sixteen beds, occupied mostly
by <i>anciennes élèves</i>. I have a window behind my bed; I
have shoved the bed forward, fitted in a chair behind,
hung up my dressing-gown, and put a few books on the
floor by my side, and call it my room. I am now sitting
there writing to you. I have just room enough to move
my right arm freely, but I am out of the way, I am
breathing fresh air, so I consider myself very well off. An
old crucifix ornamented by gilded leaves hangs at one end
of the <i>dortoir</i>, two little lamps are suspended from the ceiling,
an iron bedstead and a chair are appropriated to each
individual. The floor is formed of little hexagon bricks,
which in some of the rooms are so terribly polished that
I walk on them with difficulty. The <i>dortoir</i> is seldom
quiet; the girls sit there a good deal, and some who have
watched through the night are generally there in bed;
and how French girls do chatter! How they do go into
sudden fits of ecstasy or rage! Once at least in the
day we have a grand storm, Madame Blockel coming in
for some trouble or other, in which she and the accused
out-scream each other, and appear to be mortal enemies
for a few minutes, and the best of friends immediately
after. At twelve o’clock we receive our supply of bread
for the day, which we keep in our bedroom and take
backwards and forwards to meals. I have frequently
wished that you could see me walking gravely along the
gallery with my loaf of bread wrapped in a napkin under
my arm. The dining-room is a large hall full of round
tables, only three of which are occupied at present, as the
<i>élèves</i> only number thirty, instead of ninety, the usual
number. At dinner I saw them all together for the first
time; some very pretty and graceful, some very rough. I
am learning to take wine; everyone advises me to do so,
and I shall soon be able to drink my bottle a day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
</p>


<p>
There seems to be an admirable organisation of work
here in every department. I have been much amused to-day
by the lessons in theory that I have received from
my <i>ancienne élève</i> or <i>chef</i>. The pupils all sat round, and
the young instructress, furnished with some bones, gave
out an explanatory sentence, which was repeated by each
one in turn; I found it an excellent plan of learning
French. Of course, the repetition would have been
intolerable without the language, but to listen to a dozen
different voices and to repeat myself I found to be admirable
practice; indeed, being cut off from all English
communication is a great advantage in learning French.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 3.</i>—This morning I finish my letter in another
situation. I wrote last night till it was dark, and the
little lamp in our <i>dortoir</i> gave so much darkness that I
went to bed for want of light. To-day I am <i>en service</i>—that
is to say, I shall spend the day from eight in the
morning till eight in the evening in superintending the
six rooms of the infirmary. I have been handling leeches
for the first time (disgusting little things). I enter with
an <i>ancienne élève</i>, who shows me all the ways of the house.
At present the lectures have not commenced, but the
visits of Madame Charrier and the physician take place
every day; and nature is always here in great abundance
to be studied. I feel I shall gain a great deal, and
hitherto it has really not proved nearly so formidable an
imprisonment as I supposed. The air is delightful this
beautiful summer weather, the girls pleasant. There is
much to interest in so large an establishment, and I suppose
the three months will soon slip away, for I have
entered, in my own mind, only for the three months,
though I have been asked so often if I am going to stay
two years that I have had to tell a great many—evasions.
I shall have, doubtless, many weary moments, but I want
you all to know that it will not be so utterly miserable as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
my former letters may have represented it. And great
will be the reward! So send a welcome greeting to the
Voluntary Prisoner.

<i>July 1849.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear M.</span>,—I last wrote to you when I was my
own mistress; now in some measure I have given
up my liberty, and I must give you a little sketch
of my prison life, that you may be able to picture the
surroundings of your sister M.D. Imagine a large square
of old buildings, formerly a convent, set down in the
centre of a great court with a wood and garden behind,
and many little separate buildings all around, the whole
enclosed by very high walls, over the tops of which,
shining out beautifully against the clear sky, may be seen
the dome of the Panthéon, the Hôtel des Invalides, and
the whole building of the observatory which is close
adjoining. The inner court is surrounded by <i>les cloîtres</i>,
a most convenient arched passage which gives a covered
communication to the whole building, and which I suppose
was formerly traversed by shaven monks on their
way to the church, whose great painted window looks out
into the court, but which now echoes the laughter of
many merry girls, and across which at half-past seven
every morning you may see your humble servant with
her coarse <i>tablier de service</i> and little white pot in hand
hurrying to get some coffee. At half-past five every
morning I start up in bed, roused by the bustle of the
<i>élèves</i>, who are up before me. I make violent efforts to
drive away sleep, which are only partially successful, and
then follow the example of twenty girls who inhabit the
same long <i>dortoir</i>, and who are busy each by her own
iron bedstead dressing hastily to be ready for the visit.
I hasten upstairs to the long corridor, the ‘Sainte-Elisabeth,’
where my patients lie. I inquire carefully their
condition, wash them, and see that the beds have been
properly arranged. By that time it is a quarter past six;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
Madame Charrier makes her appearance and goes the
rounds, accompanied by the <i>élèves</i>, each one giving a
short report of the patients under her care. It is a funny
group: fifty women or more of all ages, wide awake from
the hurry of their duties, but dressed mostly in haste
with little white caps, coloured handkerchiefs, and the
coarser ones in short bed-gowns, their faces browned by
the sun, their hands red with hard work, but all good-tempered,
with a kind word always ready, and their black
eyes sparkling with life. We pass through the Salles
Sainte-Marguerite, Sainte-Elisabeth, Sainte-Anne, visiting
each patient in her alcove—it is seven when we finish. I
hasten back to my <i>dortoir</i>, make my bed, &amp;c., fetch my
coffee, which I procure for two sous a morning from the
superintendent of the infirmary, eat it hastily with my
bread, which is always supplied for the day at noon, and
then hurry off to the Salles Sainte-Marie and Sainte-Marthe,
where the more sick patients are placed, whom the
attending physicians visit every morning at eight. At this
visit are present M. Girardin, the chief physician, a tall,
dry, grey-haired man, full of pomposity; the <i>interne</i>,
M. Blot, a very handsome, somewhat dignified young
physician, with, I fancy, rather a cross temper; Madame
Charrier, the <i>aide-sage-femme</i>, and as many of the <i>élèves</i>
as choose to be present. This over, I make some independent
visits to cases which interest me, to the nursery,
&amp;c., and try to pick up a little here and there; then I
return to the <i>dortoir</i> and read or write a little. Afterwards
I join the class instruction in the wood, a preparatory
lesson which the elder <i>élèves</i> give to the younger ones,
and which I attend for the sake of the French. It is a
very pretty method of instruction: the young teacher
seated on the grass, all the pupils grouped around under
the thick shade of some fine tree, the atmosphere being
of an elastic purity which is truly charming. The French
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
girls have a natural talent for instruction; they are so in
the habit of talking that they never find the slightest
difficulty in expressing what they know, and their lively
perceptions give them a peculiar power for superficial
instruction. Our poor country girls find it very hard at
first to catch scientific words that they do not understand,
but in a surprisingly short time they roll them off smoothly
and to a certain extent understand well what is taught them.
</p>

<p>
At twelve the bell sounds for the first meal, only milk
being given at seven o’clock. We enter a large hall, full
of round tables, each holding twelve; to each are furnished
a couple of white plates, a tumbler and small bottle of
wine, a loaf of bread, a spoon and fork. The meal consists
of soup, boiled meat, and vegetables; it is eaten in
haste to the music of Madame Blockel’s voice, which
keeps up a storm the whole time. She is a somewhat
important personage, superintending our meals and our
<i>dortoirs</i>; she is a little red-faced, squint-eyed being, with
tremendous projecting teeth, and dressed always in rusty
black with a black cap. She is good-natured, liked by
the girls, but has a tremendous vocal organ, which is
always sounding forth at its highest pitch. Morning,
noon, and night good Madame Blockel’s voice drowns
all opposing sounds; and really now I am getting as
used to it as to a noisy street, and would not care if only
she would keep out of the <i>dortoir</i> at night when I am
sleepy, for, like a barking dog, she sets all the girls going,
and I don’t know when the storm subsides, for I sink to
sleep in spite of it. When the meal is over we present a
funny sight, each carrying off her loaf, napkin, knife, and
various bottles and remnants of dinner. I return to the
<i>dortoir</i>, do up little matters, read or attend the class
again, visit my patients in the corridor, and from two to
three go to the <i>parloir</i> to see my friends, if they are so
good as to come at that hot hour to see me. This <i>parloir</i>
is a funny affair—a plain room, filled with wooden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
benches, where all manner of rough people are assembled
to visit the <i>élèves</i>. On certain days, also, in one
corner a woman establishes a little shop, where she supplies
all the small wants of the girls in the way of haberdashery,
stationery, perfumery, &amp;c.; and in another corner
sits the old lady, <i>la dame du bureau</i>, observing everything,
and giving the signal precisely at three for the departure
of everybody. At six a second meal is served, consisting
of roast meat and some little kind of cake, and another
bottle of wine; afterwards we are free to do as we choose.
I generally sit a little in the wood and write till it is
dark; in a few days, however, the lectures commence,
and four or five hours will be occupied in that way. I
have described my idle, or rather my free days. When I
am <i>en service</i> I spend the whole day in the ward where
I am placed; or the night, if I happen to be on night
service. About three or four days are thus spent, and
after passing the night in watching I am not worth much
the next day, for I am not yet accustomed to the duty.
Then little extra touches come in to diversify the day. I
pay a visit to Madame Charrier or to Mlle. Mallet, one
of the <i>aides-sage-femmes</i>, whom I like very much, or some
difficult operation calls us to the amphitheatre. Next
week I shall be able to tell you how I like the lectures;
we shall have several each day, and I hope they will
supply the want which I now feel of an intelligent explanation
of the phenomena which I observe.
</p>

<p>
<i>August.</i>—The lectures have now commenced. From
seven to eight Madame Charrier gives her lesson every
morning; I occupy a chair beside her in consideration
of my foreignness, she being anxious that I should understand
thoroughly. I wish I could describe that lesson
to you; it is the most curious spurring-up of pupils I
ever saw, and really it makes some of them gallop admirably,
though many tumble down in the effort. Three
pupils are called down every morning, seated on a long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
bench in front of Madame Charrier’s table, and undergo
an hour’s examination on what they have heard from the
teachers. If they answer promptly and well, her satisfaction
is extreme, her face grows beautiful, and her
‘Bien! très bien!’ really does me good, it is so hearty;
but if an unlucky pupil hesitate, if she speak too low, if
intelligence or attention be wanting, then breaks forth
the most admirable scolding I ever listened to. Alternately
satirical and furious, she becomes perfectly on fire,
rises upon her chair, claps her hands, looks up to heaven,
and the next moment, if a good answer has redeemed the
fault, all is forgotten, her satisfaction is as great as her
anger. There is not the slightest wickedness about her;
she puts her whole soul into her lesson, and does not
realise how very difficult it is for ignorant girls to study a
science. At first I was a little shocked at this stormy
instruction, but really it seems almost necessary now,
and produces wonderful results. If the girls only keep
their temper under it and do not cry, it comes right at
last; but a tear is an unpardonable offence, and considered
an insult and a total misunderstanding. Madame
Charrier is a woman of great experience and always
speaks to the point, and her lessons are often very useful.
From nine till ten we listen to M. Paul Dubois. I like
his lectures exceedingly. A little, bald, grey-haired man,
with a clear, gentle voice and a very benevolent face,
he thoroughly understands his subject, and expresses
himself with precision and completeness.
</p>

<p>
At a little after twelve our dinner-bell rings, and right
glad I always am to hear it. The large round tables are
speedily encircled, all stand up, and a grace is said with
such rapidity that to this day I can make out no words
but <i>saint usage</i>, and the sign of the cross made with
wonderful dexterity on the forehead and breast. At the
conclusion of the meal another prayer rocket is sent up,
amidst laughing and bustle, and all crowd out of the hall,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
with their loaves of bread under their arms and all manner
of odd little pots full of eatables in their hands. From
one till two another lesson in the amphitheatre—which,
fortunately, is a pleasant room—from the second <i>aide-sage-femme</i>,
a lesson useful on the whole, but sometimes
a little wearisome. From two to three is the hour for
receiving visitors, but if I am not expecting a visit, and if
I have sat up the preceding night, I take a bath—for
there are six baths prepared every day at that hour for
the <i>élèves</i>. The same communism exists in the baths as
in everything else. They are side by side, in a double
row, down the middle of the room; and the withered
genius of the bath-room stands, observing every movement,
and talking an incomprehensible <i>patois</i> the whole
time. I try to imagine it is only the bubbling of water
that I hear; I shut my eyes, lie quietly for half an hour,
and fancy that I am deliciously reposing on the heaving
waters of some soft summer lake; then I spring up, take
a cold dash, to the horror of my companions, and hurry
off as fast as possible, really the better for the divine
element....
</p>

<p>
Were I a good Catholic I should find my time filled
with visits to the chapel—morning and evening prayers,
vespers, and the daily baptisms are regular services, with
numerous extras on saints’ days, &amp;c.; but most happily
I am Protestant, and again and again I have blessed
Heaven for the fact. The great fat, red-faced priest
occasionally leaves the retirement of his clerical dwelling
and strolls in the wood, or makes a visit to the infirmary;
he always gives me long stares of excessive curiosity
when I pass him, but I have taken a great dislike to
his sensual-looking worship, and will not give him the
slightest opportunity to make my acquaintance....
</p>

<p>
After dinner, when fine, I generally go into our wood,
and, seating myself under my favourite tree, I write till
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
it grows dark; or I stroll up and down the broad alleys,
sending my thoughts far off into the past or the future.
It is very pleasant in our wood; outside the walls are
large gardens and public walks, so that the air is very
fresh, and the beauty of the Parisian summer climate is
extreme. Sometimes my friendly <i>aide</i> joins me, for she
cannot bear to see me alone; it seems to the French a
sign of deplorable melancholy. She walks with me,
chatting gaily, and bearing my clumsy French with great
patience; for, as I said, she has taken a fancy to me, and
I have to welcome with a good grace the pinches, shakes,
and similar tokens of French affection. Fortunately,
however, it shows itself in more satisfactory ways also,
and I owe many an opportunity for interesting observation
to her kindness. The girls look picturesque in the
wood by the sunset light. Sometimes a group is seated
on the grass round its chief, eagerly taking in the instruction
that may aid it in the next day’s examination;
others are singing or playing; but I think I have never
seen one engaged by herself in meditation or work.
Their character is eminently social, communicative. Mr.
Doherty remarked wisely that vanity, in its widest sense,
is their ruling spirit, which makes it impossible for them
to understand the English, where pride rules. There is
one young girl I like to talk with. I have never seen
anything more graceful, lively, and finished than the little
pictures of life which she throws off with perfect ease;
every motion of her pretty little head, every gesture and
intonation is perfect, and occasionally I am really startled
by a profound view of life that she just glances at, and
then is off again. I would give much to be able to note
down some of her narrations, but when I try to turn
them into another language their exquisite spirit seems
to vanish....
</p>

<p>
You must not be surprised if my letter contains an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
immense number of perplexed parentheses, and has a
tendency to return always to the same subject. If you
could only hear ‘what hideous sounds salute mine ear,’
you would not wonder. The girls are singing hymns to
the Virgin in an adjoining room, and really, if the Virgin
be a lady of as much taste as beauty according to the
representations of Raphael, she must be considerably
annoyed by the zeal without knowledge displayed by her
admirers. Our second <i>aide-sage-femme</i> is a very pious
young Catholic, of really a sweet disposition. A week
or two ago, on the commencement of the month of
Mary, she assembled the girls together, reminded them
of the season, and proposed to meet frequently in the
evening and sing canticles in honour of the Lady, adding
that undoubtedly the object of their attention would be
gratified by this demonstration and would not be unmindful
of those who offered the homage. The proposition
was received with enthusiasm, and since that
unlucky day Mlle. Boisonnet and her followers have
exercised their lungs in season and out of season, to the
horror of all my nerves and, I fear, to the serious displeasure
of the Virgin. They have numerous little books
of canticles. I looked over the index the other day—‘Who
so pure as she,’ ‘The brightness of her presence,’
‘Mary, pray for us,’ and all such titles filled the pages.
The tunes have a striking resemblance to American camp-meeting
hymns. There is one which was certainly the
original of ‘Oh, let us be joyful.’ I often think, if H.
were only here, how he would join in honouring the
Virgin....
</p>

<p>
I must give you a few more sketches of my present
life. Imagine, then, that you have retired early to bed,
after a night spent in hard work, and the day in that
nervous mystification that follows loss of rest. You have
taken a refreshing bath and laid yourself down, encircled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
by dear memories that fan you to sleep with their gentle
dreams; you have just entered that beautiful dreamland,
when you are suddenly startled by a scream, a burst of
laughter, and then the vision of one white-robed form
darting past in the twilight, pursued by a similar form,
mysterious to your veiled senses. The chase continues
over beds and boxes, while shouts of laughter, followed
by a shower of small articles, proceed from the other
beds; then a loud smack is heard, whose nature is easily
divined by those who are at all familiar with juvenile
offenders, a spring from the bed and a rush by the injured
party follow; but still you resolutely shut your eyes and
will yourself asleep, in the fond hope that nature is really
too tired to keep awake, when a sudden rolling sound,
followed by a violent shock, at once convinces you of the
vanity of your efforts, and you resign yourself to wakefulness,
for a favourite amusement has commenced—they
are ‘promenading the bedsteads’! You must know that
our bedsteads are of iron, and placed on rollers so
movable that a slight impulsion will speed them a considerable
distance. Often in stepping into bed the slight
movement has caused the mercurial article to describe a
sudden semicircle. This property of these usually sober
pieces of furniture is taken advantage of by the girls,
who are now in a frolic and exercising in the most
ingenious way, to the unspeakable annoyance of a quiet
individual. An impulsion is given to one end of a long
row of beds, which is quickly communicated to the whole
row, or a simultaneous shock is given to the two extremities
and their force brought to bear on the unfortunate
centre. But the favourite freak is to place a bedstead at
the end of the room and drive it with great violence down
the centre. The rolling noise over the brick floor is tremendous,
and accompanied by a regular Babel of laughter,
shouting, and jokes of every description. Some get on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
top of their beds, which consist of three thick mattresses,
and jump up and down like mad things; others get up a
wild dance in one corner of the room, which grows continually
faster and noisier, and the strife of tongues is
truly astonishing. Their jokes are really amusing occasionally;
the scientific terms that they hear daily play a
conspicuous part. The frolic ends as suddenly as it
began, when, fairly full of fun, they suddenly jump into
bed, say good-night, and in five minutes all are sound
asleep. The first night I was thus rudely awakened I
was much inclined to be angry, but I philosophised a
little and came to the conclusion that it was my voluntary
action to be there, and that youthful spirits must have
free play. I pitied the poor children in their undeveloped
life and the restrictions they suffer here too much to be
disturbed by their little outburst, and the next morning
they begged me to excuse them because they were <i>so
young</i>!
</p>

<p>
My time is very fully occupied; my former leisure
moments are now employed in writing compositions and
taking observations. These last I willingly consent to; they
will be records to me of French practice. They consist
of a little history of the patient and a daily account of her
condition and treatment. But as they are in French, I
am somewhat longer in noting them down than I should
be if I could employ my own noble language. I have
made two ‘observations’ of surgical cases that have been
very much approved of. I was quite amused with one of
them. I was directed to note the case down under the
direction of my chief in that department. As usual, I did
promptly and cheerfully what was required; I wrote
all she dictated, and then I made a private memorandum
for my own satisfaction. This latter was seen by the
Superior, and immediately the ‘chief’ was directed to
copy it; she did it willingly, for she is a good little being,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
and has a profound respect for the stranger. The other
day two of our chiefs begged me to give them a private
lesson on the circulation of the blood, which I willingly
complied with. We seated ourselves in the wood, and I
explained to them what they did not know; they were
very grateful, and have come to me several times since
to beg me to continue my lesson—indeed, the girls here
have a sweet nature in many respects. There are little
jealousies and excitements amongst themselves, but they
take the right relationship to me; they think me singularly
grave and self-sufficing, but they show me continually the
utmost respect, and are always glad to do me any little service.
I frequently enter the <i>salle d’accouchements</i>, when
the other divisions are engaged there, to see what is going
on, and I always meet a pleasant welcome. One evening
I phrenologised them, to their unbounded delight; for
some time after I could never enter the room without
being surrounded by a small mob eagerly demanding an
examination. Everything delights them; they are perfect
children in their full, unthinking enjoyment of the present.
A little English lesson is a never-failing source of merriment,
and I am continually saluted with some oddly
pronounced English word, followed by a burst of merriment.
We have girls from all parts of France; some are
remarkable for their stupidity, which is generally explained
by the province from which they arrive. Madame
Charrier’s morning lesson is an ordeal through which all
have to pass, and seated by her, every morning, I have
a fine opportunity for studying the various departments
of France. When some singularly obtuse intellect has
exhausted all the patience and all the impatience of the
teacher, she folds her hands and asks in a subdued voice,
‘Mademoiselle, from what department do you come?’ and
on receiving the answer, adds, ‘Ah, then it is all accounted
for; the case is a hopeless one;’ which announcement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
greatly delights the rest of the class who belong to more
enlightened departments.
</p>

<p>
We have one <i>élève</i> who goes by the name of ‘La
Normande;’ she is one of my <i>pictures</i>. A fresh, healthy
complexion, browned by the sun and the sea air of her
beautiful home, regular features, a stout, vigorous frame
that has never known a touch of sickness, she walks
about with a step that feels the ground; in her white
quilled cap, and handkerchief pinned over her bosom,
she looks with her clear blue eyes right into your face,
and has a frank, loyal manner that marks her honest,
independent nature. On Sunday she dresses in the
short full petticoat, the silk-laced jacket, and the lace cap,
with its towering pyramidal crown and circular ray-like
border, that I think I have already described to you.
She sometimes visits our <i>dortoir</i> and forms the centre of
a group, whom she entertains with her constantly overflowing
life, sometimes singing, in a deep contralto voice,
her peasant hymns to the Virgin—simple pathetic melodies
chanted under the lindens when the day’s labours are
finished—or dancing vigorously the figures, more gay than
graceful, of her country, while she sings some lively air.
I admire her vigorous life, I like to see her in the infirmary;
she tends the sick with such an honest awkwardness,
such a kind heart, and lifts them like babies in her
strong arms, that I see the green fields and smell the
sweet country air as I watch her. Then I have a little
Parisian that I hang up beside her, as plump as a partridge,
with merry black eyes, glossy hair always arranged
<i>à la mode</i>, and full of little coquettish ways. Her temper
is like a lucifer match, the slightest friction fires it; the
smile and the tear are equally ready, though the sunshine
generally prevails. She has spent several years in business
in Paris, in cigar stores and similar employments,
where she has had much to do with gentlemen, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
repeats to me the compliments they paid her, the offers
they made, and her own witty, contemptuous replies, with
the utmost <i>naïveté</i>. Poor child! she has been thrown on
her own simple instincts for protection, for her mother
was soon jealous of the attractions of her daughter, and
removed her to a distance; but the real innocence of her
heart, and a true attachment to a young ship’s surgeon,
seem to have supplied the place of her natural protectors.
But true to her Parisian blood, she has coquetted from
first to last, and she never talks to me now but I find it
playing in every dimple. Think of it! she was given me
as my ‘Chief of Theory’! Now she asks me in the
sweetest manner if I will come sometimes to her lessons,
and explain to the girls what she does not understand.
Poor child! I willingly oblige her.
</p>

<p>
But I must not weary you with my portrait gallery,
my walls are covered with curious figures; let me sketch
for you our ‘vaccinations,’ which take place every Tuesday
at one o’clock. The numbers of the babies are
distributed beforehand amongst the <i>élèves</i> who are to
perform the operations; thus, 25 Ste. Marie to one, 32
Ste. Marthe to another, and so on. The <i>élèves</i> seek their
babies and bring them into the Hall of the Nurses, a
large upper room, full already of women and babies. A
space is cleared by one of the windows, chairs placed; in
the centre sits M. Blot, the director of the operation; I
occupy a chair beside him. Mademoiselle, who superintends
another division, stands beside, and then baby after
baby is subjected to the awkward manœuvres of the <i>élèves</i>,
to their utmost dissatisfaction. The babies are very ugly
in their coarse hospital swaddling clothes; I never saw
the little beings so enveloped before. They are just like
mummies, but they perform a terrible concert altogether,
with the voices of the <i>élèves</i> to help them. I sit a quiet
spectator of the operation, occasionally addressing a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
question to M. Blot as he touches knife after knife on
the arm of the infant before him; which question seems
rather to embarrass the handsome <i>interne</i>, for he colours,
or passes his hand through his hair and looks intently at
the baby, in a very un-Frenchmanlike manner. I think he
must be very <i>young</i>, or very much in awe of me, for he
never ventures to give me a direct look, and seems so
troubled when I address him that I very rarely disturb
his life in that way.
</p>

<p>
I think I have given you enough of my external
hospital life to enable you to picture me somewhat in my
surroundings; do you want to know how the spirit feels
in its curious home? Then know, dear friends, that it is
strong and hopeful, that it has moments of weariness, of
intense yearning for its true related life, but that it lives
ever in the great presence of the Eternal, and feels the
angels always near.

The difficult breaking-in to the practical work of
the obstetrician is noted in the journal of those
days; and also the pleasant comradeship which
gradually sprang up with the very intelligent young
physician who served as <i>interne</i> at that time; this
companionship was a great relief to my imprisonment
in La Maternité.
</p>


<h3>
<i>Notes from the Journal.</i>
</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>July 4.</i>—Attended lessons by the <i>aides-sages-femmes</i>;
very clever instruction. Spent the day in the <i>salle
d’accouchements</i>, but was disgusted by the treatment
of a <i>primipara</i>. With all the instruction they have
received, the very first principles of humane treatment
seem too often neglected. They are still ignorant midwives
with their mischievous interference.... The version
seemed to me horrible. I almost fainted.... Spent
the night in the infirmary—weary work. I cannot bear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
this loss of sleep.... To-day, three operations; much
interested in the morning, but grew weary and disgusted
in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 22.</i>—Attended the <i>interne’s</i> visit and spoke to
him about one of the patients; he replied so pleasantly
that I said a little more, and he promised to lend me a
medical journal to look over, and see how I liked it. The
little friendliness encouraged me....
</p>

<p>
<i>August 12.</i>—The poor woman whom I have attended
as my first complete patient gave me a little <i>prie-dieu</i>
which she had made. Her humble heart longs to express
its gratitude. I put it in my Bible where my friends are
reading to-day.... M. Dubois again waited after the
lecture to say a few pleasant words. He wished I would
stay a year and gain the gold medal; said I should be
the best obstetrician, male or female, in America! Had
quite a pleasant visit to the infirmary, where M. Blot
made me observe several interesting points, and answered
my questions intelligently and frankly....
</p>

<p>
<i>August 24.</i>—Quite taken by surprise at the infirmary
visit this afternoon. M. Blot met me so pleasantly, and
asked me to give him some lessons in English. I think
he must have been meditating this request for some time;
it had hardly the air of a spontaneous thought. I like him.
I hope we may come a little more closely together....
</p>

<p>
<i>September 2.</i>—I have been quite happy for three
hours. I must note down what I’ve learned. M. Blot
brought his microscope to the Infirmerie des Élèves. I
was exceedingly interested in his microscopic lecture.
He showed us in a work of M. Hébert’s the difference
between the epithélium pavimenteux, such as covers the
tongue, skin, &amp;c., and the epithélium vibratile, as in other
parts, and the fibro-plastic formations in the reparation of
tissues, showing specimens of each kind. The first
species was represented by a cellule full of little cellules,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
a <i>noyau</i> in the centre containing a nucleolus—thus....
The second was of elongated form, thus.... The third
represented the growth of fibre from cells, which cells
are distinguished from the first by the relatively smaller
size of the <i>noyau</i>, thus.... By such examination different
formations can be distinguished from each other;
thus cancer possesses very distinctive elements. It is
necessary to examine bodies of varying shapes under
different foci of the microscope, otherwise illusions may
be created. In illustration he placed some blood globules,
and showed us that what appeared a central spot in each
globule was owing to the convexity not being in focus,
and it disappeared when the focus was a little lengthened.
He spoke also of a paper read before a society yesterday
by a young physician, which proved that the azote, which
in the ox is voided by the excrement, in the cow is
absorbed into the milk; and that the difference in the
manure of the two is great.
</p>

<p>
He is busy himself now in preparing for an examination
of <i>internes</i>; if he gain the gold medal, he has the
right to enter any hospital he chooses as <i>interne</i> for a
second term, and receive also his M.D., not otherwise
granted to an <i>interne</i>. What chance have women, shut
out from these instructions? Work on, Elizabeth!...
</p>

<p>
To-day M. Blot spoke of a friend, Claude Bernard, a
distinguished young inquirer, who is now, he thinks, on
the eve of a discovery that will immortalise him—viz.
the discovery of an accessory circulation, by which substances
are sent directly to the kidneys without traversing
the general circulation, which will explain, for instance,
the rapid effect of champagne on the kidneys. This
second heart is situated in the ascending vena cava, close
by the liver; strong muscular fibres are evident in the
human subject, but in the horse are as large as quills.
He does not perceive yet what veins return the blood, if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
his supposition be true. He also spoke of the power
which the liver has of secreting sugar in a normal state,
when animals are fed on certain substances which can be
so converted; also of the curious experiment by which
a dog was made, in his presence, to secrete albuminous
or diabetic urine, according to the pricking of one or
another point of the pneumogastric nerve near its
origin....<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
</p>

<p>
At the afternoon visit we had quite a philosophical
discussion on society, &amp;c. Mlle. Mallet was delighted
with a <i>bon mot</i> of M. Blot. She remarked that she understood
that <i>les demoiselles</i> had answered like <i>anges</i>.
‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘<i>en ôtant le g</i>.’ They had been unusually
stupid! She asked me if M. Blot were not rather
<i>moqueur</i>. I said I did not know, but that I had discovered
that he was very ambitious. His sentiments seem to be
good, but his character is certainly not French.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 21.</i>—M. Dubois stopped to speak to me
after the lecture, and again expressed his great desire
that I should remain a year in the institution. I told
him I had determined to remain another three months;
but I had many other branches to study. He replied
that anything else I might learn elsewhere as well as in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
Paris, but that the opportunity of seeing all that was
remarkable in three thousand deliveries in that space of
time could be met with nowhere else in the world; that
it equalled the whole practice of most physicians, and he
was persuaded that I should regret it if I did not remain.
He parted saying he would talk the matter over again
with me. If it be pure interest that makes him urge this,
I am glad; but it seems to me now an impossible endurance.
</p>

<p>
<i>October 4.</i>—Another midnight scene—a strange spectacle
of suffering and of science. As I stood on the
crowded benches of the amphitheatre I heard the clock
strike one, the holy noon of night. I wondered how long
our sins would thus be fearfully visited upon us. The
rain beat in torrents on the skylight, the wind shook the
building, and I could look with intense interest on that
rare and dangerous accident submitted to our investigation—lithotomy,
the only way to save life; a tedious
operation lasting, I should think, an hour, for in the hurry
of midnight dressing I had forgotten my watch....
</p>

<p>
To-night I have been walking in the wood; the wind
blows fresh under the clear starlight. I am happier now
that my mind is clearly determined to leave at the end of
six months, with the conviction that my work here is
thoroughly done....
</p>

<p>
<i>October 30.</i>—Madame Charrier sent for me this afternoon
to present me with <i>my portrait</i>. It was a lithograph
picture of Elizabeth Blackwell, taken from a history of
<i>sages-femmes célèbres</i>. This lady, about 1737, published
a work on medical botany in two large folio volumes, in
order to get her husband, a medical man, out of prison,
where he was confined for debt.
</p>

<p>
I imagined a whole romance out of the picture, and a
little biography—a romance of a beautiful, true spirit,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
struggling with a society too strong to be turned from its
ancient habits of evil. But the pure spirit is not lost, it
is working bravely still.

<h3>
<i>A Sortie from La Maternité.</i>
</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
October 22.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Friends, one and all,</span>—Yesterday I spent
a delightful day—a day which I passed in doing nothing—and
it was so pleasant, so refreshing, that I must
tell you about it. I had laid out so many plans for
my first day of freedom. I was to see so many medical
people, and so many medical places, that I was almost
exhausted in the anticipation, and when my leave of
absence actually came, when all things worked right, and
I was neither <i>en service</i>, nor in the infirmary, nor in the
reception, and when moreover, for a wonder, it did not
rain, I just determined to give up everything like business,
forget there was such a thing as medicine or such a place
as the Maternité, and give myself up like a child to the
pleasure of looking and moving and eating, and everything
that was natural and nothing that was wise! In
fact, I found that I could really do nothing of business in
a satisfactory way in the short space of eleven hours, so my
troublesome conscience for once was quiet, and permitted
me to waste a day. I was really amused at myself to find
how anxious I was that it should not rain, and how impatient
I was for the moment to arrive when I could
leave, for by the rules of the place Anna must take me
out, and Anna must bring me back precisely at eight
o’clock! The <i>directeur</i> could not help laughing when he
informed me of these regulations; still, as he said, ‘no
exceptions could be made.’ Anna was anxious that I
should lose no portion of my short day. She woke up an
hour earlier than usual, with the sense of some weighty
responsibility resting upon her, which she could not at
first understand; but as the idea of the Maternité dawned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
upon her she rose in haste, and at nine o’clock the
summons for Mademoiselle Blackwell was shouted forth
under the windows of my dormitory. You must know
that these <i>sorties</i> are quite an event to the <i>élèves</i>; they
gather about the happy departing one with all manner of
good wishes for her enjoyment and safe return. So while
one hooked my dress, another fastened my gloves, a third
arranged my collar, the rest admired with the often repeated
compliment, ‘Oh, que vous êtes belle!’ and all sped
me on my way with the pleasant greetings of their kind,
light hearts.
</p>

<p>
How gay and free and delightful the city seemed to me
after my four months’ imprisonment—four months shut
up within the high boundary wall of the institution, with
the sky above the tops of tall houses only visible, and all
life concentrated in a single subject! My chest seemed
to grow broader as I stepped over the threshold and saw
no barrier before me, but the beautiful Luxembourg
Garden on one side, and unending streets on the other.
The variety of busy life, the gay dresses, the cheerful
houses, looked charming to me. I was surprised to find
how strange everything seemed. I really saw Paris again
for the first time, and criticised everything as on my first
arrival. We walked down the long avenue that led from
the observatory to the garden. On each side are nursery
grounds on a much lower level than the great central
avenue; they form a large lake of trees and flowers on
each side the promenade. We descended into the beautiful
flowery labyrinth to admire the magnificent dahlias of
all colours and in immense quantities. The French are very
fond of what they call <i>corbeilles</i>. There is one in every court
of the Maternité; it is a large round plot of ground, filled
to overflowing with every variety of bright flower, enclosed
by a trellis-work that is covered inside and outside
by morning glories, nasturtiums, &amp;c., so that it is nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
but a hedge of flowers. The nursery grounds we walked
through were full of these, which sent forth a delicious
odour; and occasionally they were varied by an enclosed
grass plot, hollowed out, and kept in the most beautiful
order, with bright borders of flowers. As we ascended
to the garden I was struck by the noble trees, dressed
now in their varied autumn robes, through which the
marble statues and antique palace sparkled as brightly
as in the green summer time. We were saluted by
showers of dead leaves, which gave the children much
sport and the keepers much trouble. By the western
gate is the immense block of buildings in which Anna
has her pretty <i>appartement</i>. She introduced me to them,
for the change of residence had been made since my
retirement from the world, and I duly admired the elegant
furniture, carved ceiling, tasteful paper, and above all the
pretty look-out upon a long avenue of trees whose autumn
foliage shed a warm glow through the rooms. At half-past
twelve we hurried off to attend a magnetic <i>séance</i>
at the Baron Dupotet’s, which commenced precisely at
one o’clock; and finding the omnibus too slow, we jumped
into a cab with a lady who was bound on the same
errand.
</p>

<p>
Now I must describe a magnetic <i>séance</i> to you; but
I beg that you will receive the description with becoming
seriousness, for I have a decided respect for M. Dupotet,
and if any risibility should be excited it will proceed
from your own nervous imagination, and not from my
sober portraiture. These revelations of a higher sphere
of existence are received up several pairs of stairs, in the
back-room of a house situated in the heart of the city. It
is a large, somewhat darkened room hung round with
curious pictures, and lined with very curious people.
Mesmer occupies a large frame carved with firebrands
and anchors and other significant images; he looks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
fixedly at a pale lady hanging opposite to him, who has
evidently undergone several magnetic crises. There are
some verses framed and hanging very near the ceiling,
surrounded by a thick wreath of yellow immortelles, but
I have not yet been able to decipher their meaning. On
the seats lining the walls about fifty persons assemble.
It is an original assembly always, though it seems to be
constantly changing. There was a lady with a small
hole in her cheek, a child with a crooked neck, and the
painter to the King of Sweden, with very light eyes and
hair and great impressibility, with his companion who
laughs and says, ‘Oui, monsieur,’ to every question addressed
to him; and the son of the English Consul to
Sicily, who displays a large amount of good clothes,
good flesh, a little peaked moustache, and an immense
amount of enthusiasm. But it would be difficult to give
all the varieties of structure and expression in this group
of believing heretics, some looking very fierce, some very
sheepish, some with features turned up, some with them
turned down, and some with them turned every way.
The folding-doors of this room open into a small cabinet
which is always opened on these occasions to receive
Madame Dupotet and all the impressible ladies who
form a circle inside, and go through many sympathetic
manœuvres during the magnetising in the larger room:
that is to say, the impressible ladies perform various
antics, for Madame Dupotet, who is fat, fair, and forty,
seems in no way affected, but looks on with smiling
health and assists the nervous ladies. There was one
remarkably fat dame, seated just within the folding-doors,
who had powerful fits of nervous twitching, which gave
her a singular appearance of pale, tremulous red jelly.
</p>

<p>
It would be impossible to describe the ornaments of
M. Dupotet’s study cabinet—the mystic symbols and
black-letter books of the Black Art; but there is a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
metallic mirror of oval form, traced with magic characters,
which exerts a truly wonderful effect upon impressible
subjects, exciting an ecstasy of delight or a transport
of rage; but always an irresistible attraction for all who
are affected by the magnetic influence. While M. Dupotet
has been displaying it to the one particular object of his
attention, half-a-dozen others steal up from all parts of
the room to seize the prize; one little old lady under the
magnetic influence came tottering up, with the drollest
expression of violent jealousy on her face, and with her
clenched fist prepared to fight the other equally eager
disputants for the possession of this wonderful mirror.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this particular meeting passed without
any of those singular occurrences which are said sometimes
to electrify the spectators. I heard much of the
ecstasy of a young man which had thrilled every person
present—believer or non-believer—the meeting before, in
which the ordinary law of gravitation seemed to be
superseded, and the entranced soul would actually have
fled up into the heaven it was striving for had not M. Dupotet
clasped the body tightly in his arms and commanded
it back! But though no miracle was wrought,
the faithful audience hung with intense interest on every
manifestation of simple magnetic power; the aspiring
features assumed a higher aspect, the downward ones
bent more determinedly, and the red jelly became more
tremulous at every fresh magnetisation; and when the
<i>séance</i> closed everybody shook everybody’s hand, and
found it good to have been there.
</p>

<p>
Now, do not think my picture is a caricature—verily,
I am very serious. There is an odd side to all reformers,
to all who are pursuing a new idea earnestly, that is very
whimsical. I am obliged to laugh at it; and yet I have
true respect for M. Dupotet. Though he believes in
ancient magic, though he lives in the hope of working
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
miracles, I really believe him to be an honest, enthusiastic
man, engaged with his whole soul in pursuing what
seems to him the most important of all discoveries. His
manner is perfectly unpretending, his conversation full
of good sense; for twenty-five years he has pursued the
same object, through suffering and ridicule and failure.
He is honest, I am sure; how much truth he may possess
I am at present quite unable to say; for my position,
whilst it has given me occasional glimpses of his proceedings,
has given no power of really investigating them;
but some time I hope to really study magnetism.
</p>

<p>
As we walked back we stopped at the Louvre; I
longed to see again that rich collection of art, particularly
the statues, that seemed more beautiful than ever. We
called in the Rue de Seine, hoping to gratify my old landlady,
but she was out. Then Anna introduced me to her
reading-room, where we studied the affairs of Europe,
and grew indignant at the barbarism which seems for the
moment triumphant. Anna took great pleasure all day
in filling me with all manner of eatables, having great
faith in ‘the very best beef,’ and I must confess that
when dinner was concluded my dress felt a little tight at
the waist!
</p>

<p>
Punctually at eight o’clock the recluse retired again
from the vanities of the world. But, seriously, the idle
day refreshed me; I needed it, and feel all the better for
a little change.
</p>

<p>
<i>October 24.</i>—A most pleasant occurrence. Professor
Lee, my Geneva Professor of Materia Medica, is in town,
and is coming to see me to-morrow. He has been
making a tour of two months in Great Britain, and now
he visits Paris. How glad I shall be to see him, as a
friend whom I respect, and with whom I can have a long
delightful gossip! perhaps also he can give me information
and some advice and introductions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
</p>


<p>
<i>October 25.</i>—By these most absurd regulations I was
not allowed to show Dr. Lee over the hospital when he
called. However, the <i>directeur</i> escorted him, and M. Blot
offered an introduction to Ricord.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
Although the residence in La Maternité was an
extremely trying one from the utter absence of privacy,
the poor air and food, and really hard work when
sleep was lost on the average every fifth night, yet
the medical experience was invaluable at that period
of pioneer effort. It enabled me later to enter upon
practice with a confidence in one important branch
of medicine that no other period of study afforded;
and I have always been glad that I entered the
institution, notwithstanding the very grave accident
which now befell me.
</p>

<p>
This event was noted at the time as follows:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Sunday, November 4.</i>—Served all day in the infirmary,
and witnessed M. Dayau’s first application of the serrefine.
I felt all the afternoon a little grain of sand, as it
were, in one eye. I was afraid to think what it might be,
for in the dark early morning, whilst syringing the eye of
one of my tiny patients for purulent ophthalmia, some of
the water had spurted into my own eye. It was much
swollen at night, and in the morning the lids were closely
adherent from suppuration.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 5.</i>—I applied for permission to leave until the
eye was well, and was refused. I went to the infirmary
of the <i>élèves</i> and informed M. Blot that I was prisoner.
He examined the eye carefully, discovered that it was
the dreaded disease, consulted his chief, and then told
me that as everything depended on the early active treatment,
he should give up the first days entirely to me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
He expressed much sympathy, arranged everything for
me in the most thoughtful way, and I went to bed—I
little knew for how long! I despatched a note to my
sister, and then active treatment commenced—the eyelids
cauterised, leeches to the temple, cold compresses, ointment
of belladonna, opium to the forehead, purgatives,
footbaths, and sinapisms, with broth for diet. The eye
was syringed every hour, and I realised the danger of the
disease from the weapons employed against it. Poor
Anna came down in the evening to sympathise with the
‘inflamed eye’ I had written about, and was dreadfully
shocked. She has told me since how many times she
hid behind the curtain to cry. My friendly young doctor
came every two hours, day and night, to tend the eye,
Mlle. Mallet acting in the alternate hours. The infirmary
was kept profoundly quiet, and a guard appointed day
and night. The sympathy was universal and deep, the
<i>élèves</i> asking after me with tears. An unheard-of permission
was granted to Anna to visit me three times a
day. For three days this continued—then the disease
had done its worst; and I learned from the tone of my
friends that my eye was despaired of. Ah! how dreadful
it was to find the daylight gradually fading as my kind
doctor bent over me, and removed with an exquisite
delicacy of touch the films that had formed over the
pupil! I could see him for a moment clearly, but the
sight soon vanished, and the eye was left in darkness.
</p>

<p>
For three weeks I lay in bed with both eyes closed,
then the right eye began to open gradually, and I could
get up and do little things for myself. How kind everybody
was! I shall never forget it. Anna, with her faith
in magnetism, came down regularly three times a day in
rain and snow to sympathise and impart ‘the vital fluid.’
My friendship deepened for my young physician, and I
planned a little present for his office. Madame Charrier
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
entered into it with spirit; we had long discussions together,
and finally secured an elegant pair of lamps for
his consultation-rooms, which I hurried through the corridors
to see, bundled up in my dressing-gown and shawl,
looking and feeling very much like a ghost. The lamps
were conveyed to his room that night. The next morning
he came to me evidently full of delight, and longing
to be amiable, yet too conscientious to infringe the rules
of the Maternité by acknowledging the present. He
admired my braid of long hair, wondered how fingers
without eyes could arrange anything so beautifully regular;
spoke of the Protestant religion, thought if he joined
any Church it would be that; turned to go, turned
back again, and was evidently hardly able to leave
without thanking me. Mlle. Mallet told me that the
night before he had run in to Madame Charrier to tell
her of his present, and on his way out passed by the
cloisters in an evident perplexity, longing to enter the
infirmary of the <i>élèves</i>, but unable to do so. I do admire
his delicate conscientiousness!
</p>

<p>
I received a visit from M. Davenne, who had sent me
a message of sympathy. I could not clearly make him
out with my dim eye, but had a general idea of a short,
elderly man standing hat in hand, and regarding me
as one would a solemn religious spectacle. M. Boivin
made some very friendly remarks to me, and concluded,
raising his hand, ‘et, voyez-vous? c’est d’une patience.’
</p>

<p>
‘Angélique!’ replied M. Davenne.
</p>

<p>
<i>Saturday, 22nd.</i>—Oh, how happy I am at this moment,
for Dubois has just left me, understanding for the first
time the justice of my determination to obtain a full
medical education, and obliged to confess that I was
right in principle. I shall have my <i>congé</i>, and a hope of
<i>cliniques</i> and study in the Eccentric hospitals. Heaven
has answered that heart-cry of the other night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Wednesday, 26th.</i>—Off actually! I dressed for the first
time. Bandaged and veiled; the carriage drove to the
door, Anna guided me in. I made kind adieus, caught
glimpses of stone walls in the cold dull light, and thus
ended my Maternité life. I felt very weak, and laughed
hysterically the whole evening.
</p>

<p>
The following letter, written at this time to an
uncle, an officer in the British army, shows the
important support which the mind can render the
body in combating disease:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Uncle</span>,—I thank you with all my heart for the
kind sympathy you have expressed for me so warmly.
Fate certainly gave me a strange and sudden blow, but
now I am up again strong and hopeful, and eager for
work, and I beg uncle to feel quite sure that a brave
soldier’s niece will never disgrace the colours she fights
under; but will be proud of the wounds gained in a
great cause, and resolve more strongly than ever to
‘conquer or die.’ In truth, dear friends, the accident
might have been so much worse that I am more disposed
to rejoice than to complain. Even in its present
state the eye is not a very striking disfigurement, and it
will gradually become still less so. As to the more
serious consideration—loss of vision—I still hope to recover
that in time, and meanwhile the right eye grows
daily stronger. I can write without difficulty, read a
little, and hope soon to resume my usual employments.
I certainly esteem myself very fortunate, and I still mean
to be at no very distant day <i>the first lady surgeon in the
world</i>.
</p>

<p>
I find from your letters that there is a possibility of
your visiting Paris. I should rejoice in the prospect of
meeting you, if my own stay were certain; but it is by
no means so. I have already accomplished much in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
France, but I find it very difficult to proceed further;
still, I cannot yet judge decidedly of my prospects. I have
just received permission from Government to visit the
hospitals, which is encouraging, and one opening may
lead to others, so that I may still hope to meet you some
day, unless you should grow frightened at the idea of my
scalpel and lancet, and feel uncertain how far the ties of
relationship may modify the experimental researches of
the medical student!

<p>
But the six months which followed my departure
from the Maternité proved to be a time of great mental
suffering, under which a strong physical constitution
threatened to give way; for the condition of the
affected organ entirely prevented that close application
to professional study which was needed. Both
anatomical and surgical work were out of the question;
and even reading had to be laid aside. I
followed a few lectures and some <i>cliniques</i> at the
Hôtel-Dieu, by permission of M. Roux, and engaged
a <i>répétiteur</i>, but this was quite inadequate to accomplish
the end in view.
</p>

<p>
In June of 1850 a visit to the fine mountain air
of Priessnitz’s famous establishment at Gräfenberg
was resolved on, in the hope of regaining strength
and power of study. Travelling rapidly through
France, Germany, and Prussia, in five days I reached
the famous water-cure region. On the journey a
day had been spent in Berlin, where I had been
struck by the arrogance of the Prussian officers, and

the fear which was expressed by a friend with whom
I talked freely in Kroll’s Garden lest conversation
should be overheard!
</p>

<p>
Freiwaldau, at the foot of the Gräfenberg, was
full of <i>Kurgäste</i>; but, being warned by a lady to
whom I brought an introduction that it would be
impossible for a lady to go alone to the Gräfenberg
Hotel, for it ‘was full of gentlemen who went about
in their shirt-sleeves,’ I was rather perplexed as to
where to go. A home letter describes this curious
experience:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Gräfenberg</i>, 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>—On a shady seat on the brow of
a hill commanding a most beautiful prospect. Dearly
beloved people, this cometh to you from a very watery
person in a very watery place. The sound of water is
heard everywhere. But I must give you some particulars.
Not being able to find lodgings in Freiwaldau, I
left word for Priessnitz to call, and was sitting in my
little upper room at the hotel, feeling decidedly blue,
when the door opened and in walked a middle-sized,
elderly man, with sun-burnt face marked with the smallpox,
with grey hair, light-blue eyes, a pleasant expression
of face, and dressed in country-best style. I liked
his appearance, ’twas honest and good. He examined
me very closely with his little blue eyes all the time I
was explaining my wishes. Then, in his abrupt manner,
he told me he could make me quite strong in about six
weeks, and the cure would do no harm to my eye.
When I told him that I was informed Gräfenberg was
quite full, he said, ‘You <i>can</i> come, child; come this
afternoon, and bring your things with you,’ and off he
went. I felt quite relieved to be spared the bother of
lodging-hunting and housekeeping. I determined to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
face the innumerable gentlemen in shirt sleeves, and let
properness go; if the <i>Gräfinn</i> did not like my position—why,
she might dislike it! When I reached the place of
my destination I was a little confounded. At the very
top of the house, with bare rafters for the roof and the
wall, a row of little windows a foot high let into the roof
above my head, a wooden crib full of straw, three wooden
chairs, a table, and low bureau with a green earthenware
bowl; this was my room and its furniture. I must have
looked rather dismayed, for the girl hastened to inform
me that I had an Italian count and countess for my next-door
neighbours, and that there were eight ladies and
eight gentlemen on the same floor, and that we should
be out in the woods all day. Of course I could say
nothing when I found I had such noble neighbours, or
rather when I found that it was really the last vacant
room in the house!
</p>

<p>
When the bell rang for tea I was shown into an
immense hall that might seat 500 people, gaily painted,
and ornamented with chandeliers. I sat down and found
myself, to my utter amazement, beside a row of ladies in
grand toilette gossamer dresses with short sleeves and
waists a <i>little lower</i> than I thought waists were ever
worn; hair dressed out with curls and flowers, bracelets
(I counted five on the arm next me) and rings to match!
The long tables were covered with alternate bowls of sour
and sweet milk, and brown bread and butter. The bread
looked inviting, but when, with difficulty, I had sawn off
a morsel, it was so sour that I could hardly swallow it;
but the milk was good, and I did it justice. People kept
coming in in groups, very merry, but all talking German;
the gentlemen, I presume, were in shirt sleeves, but as
they were all covered with coats, I was not shocked!
</p>

<p>
The next morning early I went through a series of
hydropathic operations, at which Priessnitz assisted, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
he always does the first time. The course never varied—viz.
packing, a half-bath, a plunge bath, a wet bandage,
and some glasses of cold water at six o’clock in the
morning; an <i>Abreibung</i>, sitz bath, and another wet bandage
at twelve o’clock; ditto at four <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and water <i>ad
libitum</i> all through the day.
</p>

<p>
The diet is plain, but every morning an old woman
opens a white-bread shop outside the dining-room, to
which almost every one is customer. Each one comes in
from the early morning walk, buys a roll, and marches in
with it under his arm; and morning and evening the
little strawberry gatherers offer the Alpine strawberries,
with their fine wild-wood flavour, for sale.
</p>

<p>
Everybody seems to have a good appetite. My own is
ravenous; a half-day in the open air, rambling over these
fine mountain-sides, stimulated by the wind and the
abundant really living water, I find myself suddenly in
strong, vigorous health, and the idea of sickness seems a
fable.
</p>

<p>
At first I felt very lonely in such a large assembly;
but now I speak to a good many, and I have found one
young American, Mr. Glynn, who seems like a brother in
this concourse of strangers. He is about twenty-two,
nearly blind from amaurosis, but one of the ‘smartest’
fellows I have ever met; quick as a flash, full of Yankee
shrewdness, he bears his terrible misfortune with real
heroism, and has rendered me numberless little services.
</p>

<p>
There are several mountain-sides laid out with walks
innumerable. The favourite early morning walk is to the
Priessnitz spring; you wind round and up the mountain,
partly through open, sweet-smelling fields, partly through
pleasant fir woods, passing several springs by the way,
each with its name and inscription and rustic seats
around; at each you stop and drink, chat a little with
those you meet, and perhaps sit down for a few moments.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
It is very sweet at this hour: the leaves smell so fresh, the
beautiful flowers are covered with dew, and the cuckoo is
heard in the woods all day. This stroll generally occupies
two hours....
</p>

<p>
It is very amusing to watch the people. Gräfenberg
is the rage in Germany; all classes are represented here.
The Countess von Westhalp offers to introduce me to a
fashionable English circle in Freiwaldau, headed by Lady
Darley; and to our great indignation the ‘butcher’ Haynau,
notorious for his barbarities, made his appearance
here one day. In the house we have gymnasium, billiard-room,
library, theatre, and balls frequently take place....
</p>

<p>
Priessnitz has 500 patients under his care, and with
their friends they amount to hundreds more. You see
him sitting at the head of one of the large tables, three
times a day, looking very pleasant. He is quiet and
simple in manner, but has a very determined mouth.
They say he is proud of having been an Austrian serf.
His pleasant-looking daughter is married to an Hungarian
baron.
</p>

<p>
These foreign titles are really a farce. I am here in
my loft one day, in slippers and old dressing-gown, when
a knock comes to my door. When I open it, a tall, black-whiskered
foreigner appears, who presents the respects of
Mme. la Princesse Obolenska, and hopes I will call upon
her when I next go to Freiwaldau. The man made quite
sure that I was I—as well he might, for I never had
quite such queer surroundings.... I paid my visit, a
professional one, after all. I had to put up with four
gulden, instead of the honour; but she was a simple,
pleasant lady, and we parted on the pleasantest terms.
This was, in fact, my first regular professional consultation.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
The air and water, however, of that lovely region,
with the constant outdoor life and endless rambles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
over the Bohemian mountain-sides, proved too
stimulating to the still sensitive organ: a violent
attack of inflammation supervened. With great difficulty
I returned to Paris, and placed myself under
the care of the famous oculist Desmarres. This
gentleman rendered me the most skilful and generous
aid. In the course of a few weeks he restored me
to active work again, although the sight of one eye
was permanently lost, and the intention of making
surgery a speciality necessarily abandoned.
</p>

<p>
During this trying period of Parisian study, my
cousin, Mr. Kenyon Blackwell, a South Staffordshire
ironmaster, was endeavouring to promote my strong
desire to study in one of our London hospitals. He
applied to the able and highly esteemed dean of St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital, who presented the application
to the treasurer. The subject was referred to
the Medical Council of the hospital. The result
was forwarded to me as follows:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At a House Committee held on Tuesday, the 14th
day of May, 1850, a letter addressed to the treasurer
from Mr. Paget, communicating to him the request of
Miss Elizabeth Blackwell, a lady well connected in this
country and the United States, to attend as a student in
the wards and other departments of the hospital, was
read, when the treasurer reported that the same had been
referred to the Medical Council, and the opinion of all the
members of the council having been read, and Mr. Paget
having attended and furnished the committee with such
information as was required, it was resolved:
</p>

<p class="p2">
‘That in the opinion of this committee Miss Blackwell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
should be admitted as a student under such regulations
as the treasurer and almoners may from time to time
deem necessary.’
</p>

<p class="signature">
James Paget, Esq.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
The ticket of admission forwarded at the same
time granted permission to study in any ward, and
follow the visit of any physician or surgeon who was
willing to extend to me the facilities of his department.
The permission was accompanied by a
cordial welcome from the dean, Mr. James Paget,
M.R.C.S.
</p>

<p>
This was indeed joyful news. I could now in
an open and honourable way, no longer regarded with
suspicion, but protected by the highest medical sanction,
devote myself to the unlimited field of practical
medicine so cordially thrown open to me, and which
I ardently desired to study. I hastened to London,
and, after some little difficulty in obtaining lodgings,
on account of being a lady, alone, established myself
in rooms in Thavies Inn, then a delightfully quiet set
of houses, entered by an archway from busy Holborn.
</p>

<p>
Every morning after breakfast I now regularly
betook myself to the hospital, spending many hours
there daily, and making the Faith wards, under
Dr. Burrows, my headquarters; but Messrs. Lawrence,
Stanley, and Lloyd courteously welcomed me
to their wards. Indeed, every department was cordially
opened to me, <i>except the department for female
diseases</i>!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Kind old Dr. Hue was always ready to show me
cases of interest, and he took me by an underground
passage, which led to Christ’s Hospital, to taste the
famous pea-soup made for the lads of that old
Foundation school.
</p>

<p>
I particularly valued the special visits of clinical
observation, without students, which Dr. Baly and
Mr. Kirkes were making.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kirkes was preparing a new edition of his
excellent ‘Student’s Physiology,’ and Dr. Baly was
pursuing his valuable investigations on dysentery.
In relation to the latter, it is noted in my journal:
‘He is so gentle, so friendly, and so learned in his
art, that he teaches me more than anyone else.’
</p>

<p>
I also attended Mr. Paget’s admirable lectures on
pathological anatomy, given in the amphitheatre.
My seat there was always courteously reserved for
me. I experienced also the utmost consideration
from the students, a large class of whom always
followed Dr. Burrows’s visits. Indeed, so natural
did this innovation of a lady student soon become,
that when, the following year, I paid my farewell
visit to the treasurer, he remarked, to my great
gratification, ‘Why, we had quite forgotten you were
here!’
</p>

<p>
Many home letters mark the various incidents
of this extremely interesting period of study.

London, 28 Thavies Inn: November 1.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Friends</span>,—When I arrived in London on
October 3, I was actually dismayed by the intolerable atmosphere,
the dense envelope of foggy smoke that made me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
sick during the day and kept me awake at night; and as I
continued to make observations on persons and things,
and finally settled down in my present prosaic lodgings,
I asked myself with astonishment, Is this the same London
I saw a year and a half ago, or is it a different person
examining the same objects? But now, happily, that
state of forlornity has passed away. I have almost forgotten
the smoke; my lodgings are clean and convenient.
I am making friends, and I shall use all the opportunities
I can get for studying social subjects and seeing society,
provided they do not interfere with my work and are not
too expensive.
</p>

<p>
My first introduction to St. Bartholomew’s was at a
breakfast at Mr. Paget’s. He has a house within the hospital
boundaries, and a special oversight of the students.
At the commencement of each session he invites the
students to breakfast in parties of about a dozen, and to
one of those breakfasts I, on my arrival, was invited. The
students seemed to be gentlemanly fellows, and looked
with some curiosity at their new companion; the conversation
was general and pleasant, the table well covered,
Mrs. Paget very sensible and agreeable, so that it was
quite a satisfactory time. Soon after I was invited to meet
a distinguished German gentleman, Professor Kölliker,
whom I found most agreeable and intelligent. My old
acquaintance, Professor Owen, entertained us with traditions
of London. Dr. Carpenter was also present, and
some of the older students, looking very amiable, though
awkward. The gentlemen I find more friendly than
the ladies; I fear I shall find them in the shocked
phase this winter. There are, however, a few decided
exceptions....
</p>

<p>
But now I am going to tell mother of a visit which I
made yesterday on purpose to amuse her—viz. to our old
Bridge Street minister, Dr. Leifchild, whose christening
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
of me I distinctly remember! Between three and four,
on my return from hospital, I set out determined to hunt
up the family, and after searching directories and trudging
several miles, and being wrongly directed, when I
finally inquired at No. 5 Camden Street, a quiet, respectable
house, whether Dr. Leifchild was in, I listened
with great relief to the announcement that he was probably
taking his nap. I was ushered into a large plainly
furnished parlour, where sat Mrs. Leifchild, sewing by a
round table in the middle. My childish recollection had
retained a general impression of the person, though I
should not have recognised her. She is seventy-two, and
wearing spectacles, but does not look more than fifty, so
fresh, plump, and pretty, though unfortunately so deaf
that she could only hear an occasional word. I announced
myself. She replied, ‘I remember the family
well. Mr. Blackwell was deacon in the chapel. You
are one of his sisters.’ I could hardly make her believe
that I was third <i>daughter</i>. She remembered A. and M.
well; said they were clever girls; she knew they would
turn out something remarkable, but she had no recollection
of me. Their son John came in at that moment—a
tall, thin man, reminding me of the Lane Seminary
student, Jones. I don’t know whether I ever saw him
before. Of course the doctor was sent for to see the
stranger. I recognised him at once, and should have
known him anywhere—fat, rosy, and laughing, notwithstanding
his grey hair. I did not detect anything of the
old man in him. ‘Ah,’ said he, ‘I know that face,’ and
then he made me take my bonnet off and occupy a large
chair by the fire, and tell him all about the family, and
particularly my mother. ‘A sweet creature she was!
How I should like to see her again! Doesn’t she talk
about visiting England? I wish she would.’ He spoke
of father with great affection, as a true friend. He had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
received most beautiful letters from him. ‘If my
memoirs are published, one of his letters will appear in
them.’ They had been told that the two eldest Miss
Blackwells were very dashing girls, and wanted to know
the truth. Then, why had I come to England? I told
him I had been doing a rather singular thing; I had
been studying medicine. He looked at me to see if I
were in earnest, and then burst out into such a hearty,
merry laugh that I joined in with all my might. ‘Yes, I
had obtained a diploma as doctor in medicine.’ ‘You—doctor!’
and then another hearty laugh. Of course Mrs.
Leifchild wanted to know what we were laughing at.
‘Why, my dear, that girl there is Doctor in Medicine!’
and then I must give them the whole history; and I
certainly never had three more attentive listeners, interrupted
by the doctor’s exclamations: ‘Bless me, what she
has done; what she has suffered! Why, the girl’s a
genius! Where did she get it all from? Why, no man
could have done what she has done!’ And if ever I
stopped, John would say, ‘Now, Miss Blackwell, pray go
on; it’s the most interesting narrative I ever listened to;
you left off at Paris.’ I was much amused. To that
little family, who had been staying so quietly at home in
the same routine, it did sound like a romance. When I
had done, the doctor declared ‘it was a capital thing—it
was the beginning of a new era.’ And John at once
brought out pen and paper and begged me to give him
my autograph. The doctor said the Rev. Mr. May, from
America, was an old friend and class-mate who had
visited England about two years ago, and he graphically
described their interview. When Dr. L. opened the door,
he started back. ‘No! Yes! It isn’t—it is! It can’t
be possible! It is very certain; but won’t you let me
in?’ From Mr. May he learned that the eldest of the
Blackwells had become Socinians; and then I must give
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
an account of my religious faith. Of course I spoke up
for myself. I told him my religion was certainly a little
peculiar; but nevertheless it was a very good and very
strong one—and he didn’t seem much troubled about the
state of my soul; indeed, I believe that, on the whole, he
considered that it was a little safer than most of the
ladies’ of his acquaintance! So, mother, I beg you to
take the same view of the matter. Altogether, I met
with the heartiest reception. The doctor placed all his
influence at my service, and Mrs. Leifchild will write you
all the news of your old Bristol friends. So I hope you
approve of my calling....
</p>

<p>
Now I am writing in a queer place—viz. one of the
wards of St. Bartholomew’s, whilst awaiting the visit of
one of the physicians. This famous old hospital is only
five minutes’ walk from my lodgings, and every morning,
as the clock strikes nine, I walk down Holborn Hill,
make a short cut through the once famous Cock Lane,
and find myself at a gate of the hospital that enables me
to enter with only a side glance at Smithfield Cattle
Market. ‘Punch’ had really frightened me by his account
of the dangerous tumult of animals; but, happily, I need
only glance across the open space, forgetting the bulls,
pigs, &amp;c., that occupy it now, and also the fearful fires of
persecution once lighted there, and try to bring back the
time when it was lined with gay tents, and surrounded
by galleries filled with beauty, eager to witness the brilliant
encounters of arms that took place there in the age
of tournaments. Now a little dark figure with doctorial
sack and writing-case under arm makes its way through
assembling students, who politely step aside to let it
pass, and entering the museum, studies its numerous
preparations till the hour of lecture, when an attendant
shows it to a seat. I only attend regularly one course of
lectures—viz. Mr. Paget’s very interesting course on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
pathology. Mr. Paget spoke to the students before I
joined the class. When I entered and bowed, I received
a round of applause. My seat is always reserved for me,
and I have no trouble. There are, I think, about sixty
students, the most gentlemanly class I have ever seen.
I have been here about ten days. There are so many
physicians and surgeons, so many wards, and all so
exceedingly busy, that I have not yet got the run of the
place; but the medical wards are thrown open unreservedly
to me, either to follow the physician’s visits
or for private study; later, I shall attend the surgical
wards. At first no one knew how to regard me. Some
thought I must be an extraordinary intellect overflowing
with knowledge; others, a queer, eccentric woman; and
none seemed to understand that I was a quiet, sensible
person who had acquired a small amount of medical
knowledge, and who wished by patient observation and
study to acquire considerably more. One of the old
physicians takes much interest in the strange little
doctor, and has given me valuable hints from his own
experience; but I confess that this system of practice is
both difficult and repellent to me; I shall, however, study
it diligently. Mr. Paget, who is very cordial, tells me that
I shall have to encounter much more prejudice from
ladies than from gentlemen in my course. I am prepared
for this. Prejudice is more violent the blinder it is, and
I think that Englishwomen seem wonderfully shut up in
their habitual views. But a work of the ages cannot be
hindered by individual feeling. A hundred years hence
women will not be what they are now.

The growing perplexity of the conscientious
student awakening to the uncertainty of the art of
medicine is now apparent in letters written at this

<i>November 20, 1850.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear E.</span>,—I want to talk to you seriously about the
future—that is to say, my <i>medical future</i>. It has been a
heavy, perplexing subject to me on what system I should
practise, for the old one appeared to me wrong, and I have
even thought every heresy better; but since I have been
looking into these heresies a little more closely I feel as
dissatisfied with them as with the old one. We hear of
such wonderful cures continually being wrought by this
and the other thing, that we forget on how small a number
the novelty has been exercised, and the failures are never
mentioned; but on the same principle, I am convinced
that if the old system were the heresy, and the heresy
the established custom, we should hear the same wonders
related of the drugs. Neither hydropathy nor mesmerism
are what their enthusiastic votaries imagine them to be.
At Gräfenberg I could not hear of one case of perfect
cure, and unfortunately the undoubtedly great resources
of cold water are not so developed and classified as to
enable a young practitioner to introduce it, professedly,
into his practice. Mesmerism has not converted me
since watching its effects on patients. I do wish most
heartily that I could discover more of the remedial agency
of magnetism, for my conviction is that it ought to be
powerfully beneficial in some cases; and as I find they
have a magnetic dispensary here in London, I shall certainly
try and attend it frequently. I am sorry that I
have been unable hitherto to attend more to homœopathy,
the third heresy of the present time, but I am trying now
to find out opportunities. Here I have been following now
with earnest attention, for a few weeks, the practice of a
very large London hospital, and I find the majority of
patients do get well; so I have come to this conclusion—that
I must begin with a practice which is an old-established
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
custom, which has really more expressed science
than any other system; but nevertheless, as it dissatisfies
me heartily, I shall commence as soon as possible building
up a hospital in which I can experiment; and the very
instant I feel <i>sure</i> of any improvement I shall adopt it in
my practice, in spite of a whole legion of opponents.
Now E., future partner, what say you—is it not the only
rational course? If I were rich I would not begin private
practice, but would only experiment; as, however, I am
poor, I have no choice. I look forward with great interest
to the time when you can aid me in these matters, for I
have really no <i>medical friend</i>; all the gentlemen I meet
seem separated by an invincible, invisible barrier, and the
women who take up the subject partially are inferior. It
will not always be so; when the novelty of the innovation
is past, men and women will be valuable friends in medicine,
but for a time that cannot be. I spend now about
three or four hours each day in the wards, chiefly medical,
diagnosing disease, watching the progress of cases, and
accustoming my ear to the stethoscope. Already, in this
short time, I feel that I have made progress, and detect
sounds that I could not distinguish on my entrance. I
advise you, E., to familiarise yourself with the healthy
sounds of the chest. When you go home, auscultate all
the family; you will find quite a variety in the sounds,
though all may be healthy persons. Lay a cloth over the
chest and listen with the ear simply; it is as good as a
stethoscope with clean people. I wish I could lend you
my little black stethoscope that I brought from the
Maternité.
</p>

<p>
I have been disappointed in one thing here—the Professor
of Midwifery and the Diseases of Women and Children
wrote me a very polite note, telling me that he
entirely disapproved of a lady’s studying medicine, and
begging me to consider that his neglecting to give me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
aid was owing to no disrespect to me as a lady, but to
his condemnation of my object.
</p>

<p>
By-the-by, I must tell you of a scientific explanation
of the toughness of meat which I obtained from Mr.
Paget’s lecture the other morning; it arises from cooking
meat during the <i>rigor mortis</i>! Would not that be a delicate
suggestion for a squeamish individual?...

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Dickson</span>,—I believe that my kind preceptor
and earliest medical friend will be interested in a little
account of my foreign life.
</p>

<p>
My request for permission to attend St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital was cordially granted, and I have received a
friendly welcome from professors and students. I have
the full rights of a student granted to me. I do not
attend many of the lectures, but confine my attention
chiefly to the practice of the hospital, and at present,
more particularly, to the medical practice. If I remain
through the summer, I shall gradually extend my visits
to the surgical and other wards, as I am particularly
anxious to become widely acquainted with disease. I am
obliged to feel very sceptical as to the wisdom of much of
the practice which I see pursued every day. I try very
hard to believe, I continually call up my own inexperience
and the superior ability of the physicians whose actions I
am watching; but my doubts will not be subdued, and
render me the more desirous of obtaining the bedside
knowledge of sickness which will enable me to <i>commit
heresy</i> with intelligence in the future, if my convictions
impel me to it. I hope you will forgive this confession of
want of faith, which I do not venture to make to my present
instructors, for the English are in general too conservative
to have sympathy with unbelief, however
honest.

<p>
I do not find so active a spirit of investigation in the
English professors as in the French. In Paris this spirit
pervaded young and old, and gave a wonderful fascination
to the study of medicine, which even I, standing only on the
threshold, strongly felt. There are innumerable medical
societies there, and some of the members are always <i>on
the eve</i> of most important discoveries; a brilliant theory is
<i>almost</i> proved, and creates intense interest; some new
plan of treatment is always exciting attention in the
hospitals, and its discussion is widely spread by the
immense crowds of students freely admitted. The noble
provision of free lectures, supported by the French Government,
increases this tendency; the distinguished men
who fill the chairs in these institutions have all the
leisure and opportunity necessary for original investigation,
and a receptive audience always ready to reflect the
enthusiasm of the teacher. I have often listened to some
of these eloquent men in the College of France, their
natural eloquence increased by the novelty or brilliant
suggestions of the subject, till I shared fully in the enthusiasm
of the assembly; and then, in the excited feeling of
the moment, I would enter with some friend into the
beautiful adjacent garden of the Luxembourg, and, sitting
down at the foot of some noble statue, we would prolong
the interest by discussion; while the brilliant atmosphere,
the trees, the wind and the water, the fine old palace and
the varied groups of people moving amongst the flowers,
contributed to the charm of the moment, producing some
of the intensest pleasurable sensations I have ever enjoyed.
I cannot wonder that students throng to Paris, instead of
to the immense smoke-hidden London; here there is no
excitement, all moves steadily onward, constantly but without
enthusiasm. No theory sets the world on fire till it
is well established, and the German observers are much
more studied than the French. Everything is stamped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
by good sense and clear substantial thought; my respect
is fully commanded, but I often long for a visit to the
College of France and a stroll in the Luxembourg.

Whilst devoting all my daytime to the rare
advantage of practical study so providentially opened
to me, the evenings were in another direction equally
delightful and beneficial. I was sitting, one dull
afternoon, in my bare lodging-house drawing-room,
somewhat regretfully thinking of the bright skies of
Paris and pleasant study under the trees of the
Luxembourg Garden, when the door opened and
three young ladies entered, and introduced themselves
as Miss Bessie Rayner Parkes and the Misses
Leigh Smith.
</p>

<p>
This proved the commencement of a lifelong
friendship. These ladies were filled with a noble
enthusiasm for the responsible and practical work
of women in the various duties of life. They
warmly sympathised in my medical effort, and were
connected with that delightful society of which
Lady Noel Byron, Mrs. Follen, Mrs. Jameson, the
Herschels, and Faraday were distinguished members,
and with which the Rev. Mr. Morris and the
Hon. Russell Gurney were in full sympathy.
</p>

<p>
My young friends hung my dull rooms with their
charming paintings, made them gay with flowers,
and welcomed me to their family circles with
the heartiest hospitality.
</p>

<p>
A bright social sun henceforth cheered the somewhat
sombre atmosphere of my hospital life; for
when the day’s duties were accomplished there was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
always some pleasant social gathering, or some concert
or lecture attended with friends, to refresh the
medical student. I often walked home from my
friends in the West between twelve and one at night
(being too poor to engage cabs), not exhausted, but
invigorated for the next day’s work. Lady Noel
Byron became warmly interested in my studies. I
went with her to Faraday’s lectures, visited her at
Brighton, and she long remained one of my correspondents.
</p>

<p>
One of my most valued acquaintances was Miss
Florence Nightingale, then a young lady at home,
but chafing against the restrictions that crippled her
active energies. Many an hour we spent by my
fireside in Thavies Inn, or walking in the beautiful
grounds of Embley, discussing the problem of the
present and hopes of the future. To her, chiefly, I
owed the awakening to the fact that sanitation is
the supreme goal of medicine, its foundation and its
crown.
</p>

<p>
My acquaintance also with Professor Georgii, the
Swedish professor of kinesipathy and the favourite
disciple of Brandt, whose consultation-rooms in
Piccadilly I often visited, strengthened my faith in
the employment of hygienic measures in medicine.
When, in later years, I entered into practice, extremely
sceptical in relation to the value of drugs
and ordinary medical methods, my strong faith in
hygiene formed the solid ground from which I
gradually built up my own methods of treatment.
Looking back upon a long medical life, one of my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
happiest recollections is of the number of mothers
whom I influenced in the healthy education of their
children.

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear E.</span>,—The great topics of the day here are the
Great Industrial Exhibition and Popery.
</p>

<p>
On November 5 the bells were ringing and the boys
hurrahing for ‘Gunpowder Plot Day.’ This anniversary
was celebrated with more enthusiasm than usual from
the Pope’s having appointed a Cardinal Archbishop of
England, and ‘No Popery’ placards are posted everywhere.
</p>

<p>
The great building of iron and glass for the Exhibition
is rapidly rising in Hyde Park, and the papers in this
rank-loving country duly inform us whenever Prince
Albert comes in from Windsor to inspect its progress,
and furthermore that the Prince is modelling a group of
statuary, and the Queen designing a carpet, to figure in
the display. The last time I was at the Twamleys’ we
drove round to see the building, which is a curious sight
from the delicate appearance of the immense quantity of
iron framework; it looks too fragile to support a crowd,
and yet it will hold myriads. There is a splendid old
elm tree which they have enclosed in the building, and
his great black arms look in strange contrast to the surrounding
tracery.

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear M.</span>,—I was just stretching myself after breakfast,
and thinking that I must put on my boots and turn
out into the horrible fog that was darkening daylight,
when your welcome letters came, and it being holiday
time I treated myself to an immediate perusal. I must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
beg you not to imagine me sitting in a large bare room
in an <i>inn</i>. The term ‘inn’ is only applied in this case to
a particularly quiet and respectable little street. The
term ‘Inns of Court’ means a number of buildings round
an open court, withdrawn from the street, entered by an
arched passage under some house, and used now or at
some former time for law purposes. That was the origin
of Thavies Inn; it was formerly a portion of an old law
court, and is particularly <i>proper</i>, having iron gates at the
archway, which are shut at night, and a porter living in
the little house at the entrance, who is always on the
look-out for beggars or other un-respectable characters;
and the way in which a little barrel organ that has
managed to slip in is ‘shut up’ at the first bar has
always amused me, and provoked me at the same time.
The room also, which was bare enough at first, has
assumed a much more homelike aspect since two young
friends sent me some pictures to hang on the walls, and
a portfolio of paintings, with a little stand on which to
place a new one every day; and having turned the sideboard
into a bookcase, I can assure you it looks quite
comfortable when I have drawn the round table to the
fire and settled down for the evening.
</p>

<p>
Your letter alludes to many topics of interest. First
of all this ‘Woman’s Rights Convention,’ held at Worcester,
Mass. I have read through all the proceedings
carefully. They show great energy, much right feeling,
but not, to my judgment, a great amount of strong, clear
thought. This last, of course, one ought not to expect in
the beginning; but in my own mind I have settled it as
a society to respect, to feel sympathy for, to help incidentally,
but not—for me—to work with body and soul. I
cannot sympathise fully with an anti-man movement.
I have had too much kindness, aid, and just recognition
from men to make such attitude of women otherwise
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
than painful; and I think the true end of freedom may
be gained better in another way. I was touched by the
kind remembrance of W. H. C., which placed my name
on the Industrial Committee; and if I were in America
and called on to attend I should certainly send them a
note full of respect and sympathy; but I must keep my
energy for what seems to me a deeper movement. But
I think you did perfectly right to act on the Education
Committee, and if I can send you any information I will
gladly do so. But I feel a little perplexed by the main
object of the Convention—Woman’s Rights. The great
object of education has nothing to do with woman’s
rights, or man’s rights, but with the development of the
human soul and body. But let me know how you mean
to treat the subject, and I will render you what aid I
can.... My head is full of the idea of organisation,
but not organisation of women in opposition to men. I
have been lately meditating constantly on this idea, and
seeking some principle of organisation which should be
a constantly growing one, until it became adequate to
meet the wants of the time.... This horrible fact of
immorality has weighed upon me fearfully since I came
to London, for I believe in no city in the world does it
show itself so <i>publicly</i> as it does here. In Paris it is
legalised and hidden, and is recognised and profitable as
a branch of the Government!
</p>

<p>
In the United States it is not so old and widespread
(written in 1850); but here in London it has been let
alone, has taken an unrestrained course, exists to a
fearful extent, and shows itself conspicuously in its lowest
form. At all hours of the night I see groups of our poor
wretched sisters, standing at every corner of the streets,
decked out in their best, which best is generally a faded
shawl and even tattered dress, seeking their wretched
living; and many aching hearts I have seen looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
through the thin, hungry features. But I will not pain
you farther; you know the general fact, though you have
never had it pressed home to you in a thousand ways, as
I have. My great dream is of a grand moral reform
society, a wide movement of women in this matter; the
remedy to be sought in every sphere of life—radical
action—not the foolish application of plasters, that has
hitherto been the work of the so-called ‘moral reform’
societies; we must leave the present castaway, but
redeem the rising generation. In my own mind I have
divided my ‘Union’ into many branches, several of which
I see Mr. Channing has proposed for this ‘Woman’s
Rights Society.’ Education to change both the male and
female perverted character; industrial occupation, including
formation of a priesthood of women; colonial
operations, clubs, homes, social unions, a true Press, and
many other things, have been among my visions; and
the whole so combined that it could be brought to bear
on any outrage or prominent evil. In England I should
seek to interest the Queen, and place her, as the highest
representative of womanhood, at the head of this grand
moral army. Indeed, many of my modifications naturally
fit themselves to English society, which is immediately
around one. When I return to America, of course the
European mould of my thoughts will drop off, and fit
itself to the New World; but it never can be an anti-man
movement.... One thing now pleases me much; all
the women seem to like me, from the aristocratic Miss
Montgomery, bosom friend of one of the Queen’s maids
of honour, down to the humble sisters of the hospital,
all welcome me, and many with enthusiasm. I have
passed several delightful evenings with Mrs. Follen, Mrs.
Jameson, and the Chapmans; the De Morgans, Morells,
and many others are unceasing in their kindness. I find
these people varying in religion and everything else, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
all alive and open to progressive ideas—if they are not
shocked back. There seems to be a very large class of
this kind, who are not united in any special effort, but in
whom the true ideas are germinating, which will some
time—perhaps in their children, for things move slowly
in England—reach a perfect development. It is my
<i>impression</i>, for I ought only to put it in that modest form,
that the corresponding class in America is less humane,
more addicted to money-getting and party spirit; and
that reform ideas in America are much more talked of,
but less acted on....

April 4, 1851.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear E.</span>,—I have been very gay lately, with so many
social entertainments. One evening at the Hon. Miss
Murray’s I saw the Duchess of Buckingham, Duke of
Argyll, Marquis of Lansdowne, and many distinguished
people, Sir Lyon Playfair, Sir John Herschel, the Speaker
of the House of Commons, &amp;c. But my studies go
steadily on, and I do enjoy going round with Dr. Baly;
he is so gentle and friendly, and so learned in his art,
that he teaches me more than anyone else. I wish I
could go round with him oftener....
</p>

<p>
But I must tell you of a delightful three days’ visit
that I made to Lady Byron at Brighton a week ago. I
had heard her most highly spoken of, and her connection
with the poet has thrown a romance around her; so
when I received through Miss Montgomery an invitation
from her, stating that she had herself paid some attention
to medical matters and would be most happy to see me,
and that her friend Dr. King would do the honours of the
well-arranged hospital at Brighton, I determined to accept,
and give myself a three days’ treat. I arrived in Brighton
one bright, blowing afternoon. Nearly three miles of
good stone houses face the broad sea, the road in front
of them forming a delightful elevated promenade open
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
to the spray and the Atlantic winds. In the distance at
one extremity was Beachy Head, at the other the projecting
point that hid Portsmouth, and far out, dim in the
distance, lay the Isle of Wight. Bare, rounded, green
hills formed the background to the town. In the bow-windowed
parlour of one of these large stone houses I
was set down, and soon after, Lady Byron, who had been
to the railroad to look for me, entered—a slender, rather
small, but venerable-looking lady of sixty, with fair complexion,
delicate features, and grey hair. She welcomed
me kindly, and conversed for a little while with a gentle,
benevolent manner, but a voice that had a very sad tone
in it. I found that she was a confirmed invalid, and
learned afterwards that she had never recovered from the
blow caused by the conduct of her husband, whom she
had worshipped with real idolatry. Then we went out
to see the sunset and some electrical apparatus, and
on our return I was introduced to Mrs. Jameson, the
authoress, who was paying a little visit, and to Dr. King,
a beautiful old gentleman, more of a philosopher, however,
than a physician. The next morning I had a
delightful <i>tête-à-tête</i> breakfast with Mrs. Jameson, who is
a charming person with a warm Irish heart, an exquisite
appreciation of art, and a deep interest in all high
reform. Meanwhile it had begun to rain and the wind
battered the house furiously, but nevertheless I went in
the carriage with Dr. King to visit the hospital and a
famous manufactory of mineral waters. I returned in a
hurry to go off with Mrs. Jameson and hear Fanny
Kemble read ‘Macbeth.’ This was a great treat, for I
had never heard Shakespeare well given. I had caught
a glimpse of Fanny Kemble the evening before, when
Mrs. Jameson had brought her back from reading the
‘Midsummer Night’s Dream.’ She entered the parlour
for a few minutes, throwing open the door and declaiming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
a tragic Shakespearian quotation, dressed in rose-coloured
satin, with a crimson mantle trimmed with white fur, a
large bouquet in her bosom, her jet-black hair braided
low down, with large black eyes, and a grand, deep-toned
voice. She sat on the sofa beside Lady Byron—a most
strange contrast. She was really magnificent in ‘Macbeth,’
dressed in black velvet trimmed with ermine, and
Mrs. Jameson, who sat beside me, was in raptures.
</p>

<p>
The longer I saw Lady Byron the more she interested
me; her insight and judgment are admirable, and I never
met with a woman whose scientific tendencies seemed so
strong. She seemed well versed in medicine and was
her own physician, having consulted many physicians
who were quite unable to aid her; she has for many
years taken particular interest in labour schools, and has
some admirably arranged on her estates. I much enjoyed
my conversation with her, for she has a rare intelligence
and a long experience. On Sunday she took me to hear
a most eloquent preacher, a Mr. Robertson, who preached
on the wisdom of Solomon and Christ. He is now in
the Established Church, but will, I imagine, soon work
himself out, for he is continually progressing, and has
already drawn upon himself much persecution from his
professional brethren. I certainly never heard his equal
in torrent-like eloquence; it was quite a flood.
</p>

<p>
How gloriously the wind howled round the house at
night! As I lay in bed and listened to the wind and the
heavy swell of the waves, it was delicious. There is a
pier built far out into the water as a private promenade.
I had a beautiful walk there all alone one evening at
sunset as the tide was coming in. On Sunday afternoon
I was obliged to leave my new friends. Lady Byron, in
a purple velvet mantle lined with white silk, a rich dress,
and a purple satin bonnet trimmed with black lace, escorted
me to the cars and put me into the second class,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
which economy obliged me to take. With the most
hearty shake of the hand we parted, and we have exchanged
several notes since I returned, for, as I said, she
interests me, and I want to know more of her.
</p>

<p>
I have a standing invitation to Mrs. Jameson’s Thursday
evening meetings, of which I shall try to avail myself
frequently. Life opens to me in London, social life particularly;
but I am looking with pleasure to my return.
I am too impatient to begin my practical career to be
able to stay anywhere much longer where that is not to
be commenced....
</p>

<p>
<i>April 7.</i>—Miss Murray invited me to see the Queen’s
favourite little German baron, but I did not accept; for to
go such a distance on foot or in omnibus in my silk dress
to meet people with whom I should probably have little
sympathy, and to whom I should only seem a quiet, ill-dressed
person, seemed to me foolish.... Spent the
evening at Mrs. Follen’s. Miss Montgomery told me a
very strange story of her father’s ‘double’ appearing to
her and her brother when they were children playing
together during his absence in London. They were
amusing themselves by dressing-up in clothes taken from
a closet on the staircase, when, hearing their father’s
study door open and fearing reproof, they shut themselves
in the closet, watching through a crack of the door
their father in his dressing-gown with a candle in his
hand slowly ascend the staircase. They then remembered
that their father had gone to London, and rushed
up to their mother’s room, where she was dressing for a
party, exclaiming, ‘Papa has come home! We saw him
come out of the library with a candle in his hand and go
upstairs.’ The authority of this story was unimpeachable,
the details minute. What must one think of it?...
</p>

<p>
<i>April 17.</i>—Went down with my friend Florence to
Embley Park. The laurels were in full bloom. Examined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
the handsome house and beautiful grounds.
Saturday a perfect day. Walked much with Florence
in the delicious air, amid a luxury of sights and sounds,
conversing on the future. As we walked on the lawn in
front of the noble drawing-room she said, ‘Do you know
what I always think when I look at that row of windows?
I think how I should turn it into a hospital ward, and
just how I should place the beds!’ She said she should
be perfectly happy working with me, she should want no
other husband.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 20.</i>—A beautiful Sabbath morning. Saw the
sea and Isle of Wight in the distance; watched the
peasants’ picturesque scarlet cloaks going to church.
As we crossed the fields, conversing on religious matters,
it was a true communion....
</p>

<p>
<i>May 1.</i>—A most brilliant opening of the Great Exhibition.
Thanks to Cousin S., who is an exhibitor, we
enjoyed a sight which we shall always remember. The
place was so vast that the musical sound of the great
organ was lost in the beating of the air. The great building,
resplendent with the products of the whole world,
was filled to overflowing with enthusiastic spectators.
When the Queen, holding Prince Albert’s arm, with the
young Prince of Wales on one side and the Princess
Royal on the other, followed by the aged Duke of
Wellington arm in arm with the Marquis of Anglesea,
and a long train of nobility and distinguished men, made
the tour of the building and declared it open, it was
indeed a memorable sight.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
The advisability of remaining in England and
establishing myself in practice in London was
seriously considered at this time. Under other
circumstances I should gladly have made the
attempt, for I was strongly attracted to my native
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
land. But I was extremely poor, with no capital to
fall back on, and with a great horror of running
into debt; neither had I any circle of family friends
to aid me, and whilst I saw the importance of a
settlement in London, I realised also its difficulties.
Meanwhile the years of my study in America had
produced their effect there. Popular feeling had
sanctioned the effort. In both Philadelphia and
Boston attempts were being made to form schools
for women. My sister Emily also had adopted the
medical life. She had entered the Medical College
of Cleveland, Ohio, and was looking forward to
joining me ultimately in the medical work; my
own family also, to whom I was warmly attached,
were fully expecting my return.
</p>

<p>
I determined, therefore, after much anxious consideration,
to make my first settlement in New
York, hoping in ten or fifteen years’ time to have
attained a position, when I might be able to work
in England. The parting from English friends and
opportunities was a painful one.

<p>
I gave the day to Florence, who is about leaving,
uncertain whether she will see me again. We heard
Mr. Ellis lecture at the National Association on Political
Economy. We also visited the Verral Hospital, but were
not favourably impressed by the judiciousness of the
exercises. Dined with her at the Bracebridges’, and
parted from her with tears.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 20.</i>—Visited Guy’s Hospital, Dr. Oldham doing
the honours most kindly. The museum is the best for
study that I have yet seen. There are about 600 beds in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
the hospital; twenty are for midwifery, especially under
Dr. Oldham’s care, providing about 1,800 cases in the
year, and looked after by four young students, who are
maintained by the hospital for that purpose. There was
a room especially devoted to electrical treatment. The
whole establishment bore the marks of wealth.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 15.</i>—Wished Dr. Oldham good-bye, who expressed
great friendliness, wished to see my sister
should she visit England, and offers to make an application
for admission to Guy’s Hospital....
</p>

<p>
<i>July 17.</i>—Said good-bye to Mr. Paget, Dr. Burrows,
Dr. Hue, &amp;c.—in fact, cut my connection with the hospitals.
Did it with much regret; all were extremely kind, expressing
the utmost interest and respect for the work.
Mrs. Paget introduced me to a lady as ‘a benefactor to
the race,’ and hoped to hear of me through Mr. Paget.
He spoke of the perfectly satisfactory nature of the experiment,
and that it may be done by another lady under
similar circumstances, but <i>not</i> as a simple student, he
thinks. Dr. Burrows also was extremely friendly, and
paid me indirectly the highest compliment, as having
‘established a principle for others, by the success of my
laudable enterprise; he thought that quite a new idea
had been gained in this matter, which would help anyone
else in future.’ I found also, with mingled sadness and
triumph, that <i>now</i> I might do anything I pleased at St.
Bartholomew’s. They have learned to know and welcome
me as I am going away, and are, as Mr. Paget said, sorry
to lose me.

<i>Monday, 21st.</i>—Left London at seven o’clock. A. turned
from me in tears. I felt very sad as I looked at her thin
face and thought of all she has suffered, and will suffer....
In the evening I met a cordial welcome at Dudley....
Howy and I made an expedition to Worcester and
Malvern; it gave us an opportunity for much intimate
conversation. We had lovely weather, and found the
country exceedingly beautiful. Rode up the Worcestershire
Beacon on donkeys, eating, talking, and laughing
at our entanglement with other parties, and enchanted
with the prospect; there was a tent on the hill, and
parties dancing. We slid all the way down, and walked
by Gully’s and Wilson’s water-cure establishments.
Visited the noble old Worcester Cathedral, but looked in
vain for our crest of arms, said to be there on the
windows. Went over Grainger’s china manufactory;
the production of cups and saucers on the wheel was
like magic....
</p>

<p>
To Liverpool, but found the ship would not sail until
Saturday. The very sight of it made me sick; so Cousin
S. accompanied me to Manchester, where we had a very
interesting visit. Mr. Wilson, an intelligent business
man, escorted us over a large cotton manufactory. It
was of exceeding interest. Eight hundred looms were at
work in one room; mostly tended by women and many
very young girls. We commenced our inspection by
descending by ropes deep down into the vaults, where
the cotton arrives from America and India; we then proceeded
through room after room where all the processes
were conducted, from breaking up the bales, tearing to
pieces, sorting, carding, forming into sheets, twisting,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
spinning, weaving, and finally measuring and folding the
cloth. We went up and down, by movable trap-doors,
underground from street to street, all through the immense
establishment. The noise was tremendous, the
dust and heat oppressive. I noticed closely the workwomen,
who seemed brutified by their toil; their physiognomies
were assuming the projecting mouth of the
lower animals. Most of them carried their hair-comb stuck
in the back of their head; they were mostly youngish
women, sallow and perspiring, and I noticed one woman so
exhausted that she was obliged continually to sit down;
they had often more than one loom to feed. They keep
the men and women separate in their work as far as
possible....
</p>

<p>
<i>Saturday, 26th.</i>—Actually my last day on this noble
British land! I left pale good Cousin S. standing in the
street of Dudley; watched dear H. running up the railway
bank as I rushed off in the train; and then I felt
that I was indeed severed from England, and only anxious
to get through my journey. I found myself at night on
board ship, out in the Mersey. Another most important
page in life fairly closed!
</p>

<p>
Adieu, dear friends! Heaven keep us all!

CHAPTER V
<br />
<span  class="subhead">
PRACTICAL WORK IN AMERICA
</span>
</h2>


<p>
The first seven years of New York life were years
of very difficult, though steady, uphill work. It
was carried on without cessation and without
change from town, either summer or winter. I took
good rooms in University Place, but patients came
very slowly to consult me. I had no medical
companionship, the profession stood aloof, and
society was distrustful of the innovation. Insolent
letters occasionally came by post, and my pecuniary
position was a source of constant anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Soon after settling down I made an application
to be received as one of the physicians in the
women’s department of a large City dispensary;
but the application was refused, and I was advised
to form my own dispensary.
</p>

<p>
My keenest pleasure in those early days came
from the encouraging letters received from the many
valued English friends who extended across the
ocean the warm sympathy they had shown in
London. They strengthened that feeling of kinship
to my native land which finally drew me
back to it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A correspondence with Lady Byron, which extended
over some years, was particularly encouraging;
for the strong scientific tastes of this admirable
woman, as well as her large benevolence, led her to take
a steady interest in the study of medicine by women.
</p>

<p>
The following is a characteristic letter from this
valued friend:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
Brighton: December 9, 1851.
</p>

<p>
I received your letter some days ago, and have ever
since longed to write to you. The business which has
chiefly prevented me is of a nature to interest you. A
conference, originating with Miss Carpenter, is to be held
at Birmingham to-morrow between chaplains, governors
of gaols, magistrates, and a few ladies on the means of
saving the young from sin and reforming them after its
commission. I could not attend, and perhaps can render
as much service in absence, indirectly. Miss Murray, Mr.
Rathbone of Liverpool, Mrs. Jameson, and Miss Montgomery
will be present.
</p>

<p>
The subject of this letter is to be the magnetoscope.
The pamphlet by Mr. Rutter shall be sent you. Since its
publication new discoveries have been made and amply
tested, and of these I will try to give you some account.
One objection received as conclusive against the reality
of the magnetic influence from the operator was that the
motions of the pendulum suspended from the instrument
were produced solely by unconscious muscular movement
on the part of the operator. Although to engineers and
persons acquainted with the laws of motion this rotation
of the pendulum in the instrument appeared to be a
strange new mechanical power, yet the Royal College of
Physicians and the ‘Lancet’ decreed that it should be
explained by involuntary muscular movement, and one
M.D. of eminence wrote a letter to me implying that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
believers in the magnetoscope were to be classed with
Mormons.
</p>

<p>
It has since been proved beyond a doubt by Mr.
Rutter that the touch of the poles of a magnet or crystal
to the spot before touched by the hand will be followed by
movements exactly similar, the rotation being from east to
west or from west to east, according as the north or south
pole of the crystal is directed to the spot. After <i>contact</i> it
occurred to Mr. R. to try <i>pointing only</i> with the poles of
the crystal <i>held in his hand</i>. The same effect ensued.
What becomes of the muscular impulse theory? Another
objection is now considered as fatal—that when the eyes
are closed all motion is stopped if the operator is either
holding the thread or touching the magnetoscope. Ergo,
they say, it is all imposture. But is there not another
light thrown by this on the power of the eyes—on their
‘electric glance’? It is stated in Carpenter’s ‘Animal
Physiology’ that a woman whose left arm was palsied
could hold up a child with it <i>as long as she looked at it</i>.
When she closed her eyes the arm dropped. A Mr. John
Dimson, well known now in Brighton, has a paralytic
affection of his feet, and cannot walk unless <i>he fixes his
eyes upon them</i>. To this fact Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge
(Florence’s friends) and Lady Easthope have recently
given me their attestation as eye-witnesses, and I understand
that the fact is observed at German baths for lame
patients.
</p>

<p>
With the disposition, then, to ‘pooh-pooh’ the discovery
in London, I think it will probably be left to
America—perhaps to you!—to evolve the truth. Therefore
I shall feel it my duty to put you in possession of
facts bearing upon it. I have, however, had the satisfaction
of seeing conviction produced on the mind of one of
our most distinguished geologists, who perceived the
connection between the influences of magnetism and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
metals on the pendulum, and some of the subterranean
operations, particularly mineral springs. (My hand is
tired and must rest.)
</p>

<p>
The application of magnetism to the principle of life
is most satisfactory to me. The unification of the magnetism
of the human head by finding that the pendulum
is influenced by it, exactly as by a real magnet, that the
poles correspond, the forehead being north when the
person is upright. (Changes take place in the recumbent
position.) This is when a person stands in any direction,
<i>live</i> bodies being <i>independently</i> magnetic. It is the case
even with an egg new laid. After boiling, <i>that</i> power
ceases, and it is a magnet only <i>by induction</i>, like any
other inorganic matter. In trying experiments the feet
must not be crossed, nor the legs, nor the hands clasped,
nor thumbs joined. These attitudes all occasion the
motions to stop—for they complete this circuit—analogous
to electrical phenomena. After all, I have not told you
what appears the most curious fact in its consequences,
that (as far as yet tried) the body loses its influence on
the magnetoscope in sleep. Its polarity is gone, as in
death! ‘Twin brothers!’
</p>

<p>
On reading over what I have written I perceive a
want of explicitness, which I hope the pamphlet will
make up. I will divide it into sheets to be sent in
letters.
</p>

<p>
With a strong feeling that the ocean is not distance,
</p>

<p>
At this time I employed the leisure hours of a
young physician in preparing some lectures on the
physical education of girls, which were delivered in
a basement Sunday school room in the spring
of 1852.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These lectures, owing to the social and professional
connections which resulted from them, gave
me my first start in practical medical life. They
were attended by a small but very intelligent
audience of ladies, and amongst them were some
members of the Society of Friends, whose warm and
permanent interest was soon enlisted. Indeed, my
practice during those early years became very
much a Quaker practice; and the institutions which
sprang up later owed their foundation to the active
support of this valuable section of the community.
The family of Mr. Stacy B. Collins, a highly
respected member of the Society of Friends, will
always be affectionately remembered. They first
engaged me as the family physician. The granddaughter,
now Dr. Mary B. Hussey, was my ‘first
baby;’ and a warm friendship continues into the
third generation. The names also of Robert Haydock,
Merritt Trimble, and Samuel Willets will
always be gratefully remembered in connection with
this movement in New York. These well-known
and highly respected citizens with their families
gradually became our most steadfast friends.
</p>

<p>
My first medical consultation was a curious
experience. In a severe case of pneumonia in an
elderly lady I called in consultation a kind-hearted
physician of high standing who had been present in
Cincinnati at the time of my father’s fatal illness.
This gentleman, after seeing the patient, went with
me into the parlour. There he began to walk about
the room in some agitation, exclaiming, ‘A most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
extraordinary case! Such a one never happened to
me before; I really do not know what to do!’ I
listened in surprise and much perplexity, as it was a
clear case of pneumonia and of no unusual degree of
danger, until at last I discovered that his perplexity
related to <i>me</i>, not to the patient, and to the propriety
of consulting with a lady physician! I was
both amused and relieved. I at once assured my
old acquaintance that it need not be considered in
the light of an ordinary consultation, if he were
uneasy about it, but as a friendly talk. So, finally,
he gave me his best advice; my patient rapidly
got well, and happily I never afterwards had any
difficulty in obtaining a necessary consultation from
members of the profession.
</p>

<p>
In 1852, warmly encouraged by Mrs. Dr. Bellows,
I published the lectures I had given, under the title,
‘The Laws of Life in reference to the Physical
Education of Girls.’ This little work was favourably
regarded by physicians; it drew forth an
encouraging letter from the dean of my college,
to my very great gratification. It also happened
to fall under Mr. Ruskin’s notice, and gained his
valuable commendation.
</p>

<p>
Being still excluded from medical companionship,
and from the means of increasing medical knowledge
which dispensary practice affords, I finally determined
to try and form an independent dispensary.
</p>

<p>
In 1853, with the aid of some of my friends, a
small room was engaged in a poor quarter of the
town near Tompkin’s Square; one of my Quaker
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
friends, Mrs. Cornelia Hussey, actively assisted in
arranging drugs, covering a screen, &amp;c. This dispensary
(afterwards moved to Third Street) was
opened three afternoons in each week, and I had the
satisfaction during the following two years of finding
it welcomed by the poor, and steadily enlisting
a larger circle of friends.
</p>

<p>
In 1854 the Act of Incorporation for an institution
where women physicians could be available for
the poor was obtained, and a few well-known citizens
consented to act as trustees. The first annual
report of this modest little dispensary is given in
the Appendix. From this very small beginning have
gradually arisen the present flourishing institutions
of the New York Infirmary and College for Women.
</p>

<p>
It was during these first early years that, not
being able to continue the expense of good consultation-rooms,
I determined to <i>buy</i> a house. A friend
lent me the necessary money at fair interest, and a
house in a good situation in Fifteenth Street was
selected. This transaction proved a very material
assistance in many different ways, and enabled me
to form the home centre which is so necessary
to the most efficient work. In later years also
this early experience helped me to realise more fully
the fundamental importance of the great land question,
or ‘a stake in the soil,’ as well as other weighty
social problems.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties and trials encountered at this
early period were severe. Ill-natured gossip, as well
as insolent anonymous letters, came to me. Although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
I have never met with any serious difficulties in
attending to my practice at all hours of the night,
yet unpleasant annoyances from unprincipled men
were not infrequent. Some well-dressed man would
walk by my side on Broadway, saying in a low voice,
‘Turn down Duane Street to the right;’ or whilst
waiting for a horse-car at midnight by the City
Hall a policeman would try to take my hand; or
a group of late revellers would shout across the
street, ‘See that lone woman walking like mad!’
But with common sense, self-reliance, and attention
to the work in hand, any woman can pursue the
medical calling without risk.
</p>

<p>
The heat of a New York summer also was at
this time very trying to an English constitution.
A letter to my sister in 1853 exclaims:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Oh, dear! it is so hot I can hardly write. I was
called this morning to Flushing to see a sick child, and
then attended my dispensary, the thermometer varying
from 86 to 90 in the house, and it stood at 102 in some
rooms down town. Walk as deliberately as I would, it
made my brain seem too large for my head. Flushing
reminded me of the Sahara; it lay breathless under a
cloudless sky, leaden with
haze.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
In relation to mischievous gossip it is written:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

These malicious stories are painful to me, for I am
woman as well as physician, and both natures are wounded
by these falsehoods. Ah, I am glad I, and not another,
have to bear this pioneer work. I understand now why
this life has never been lived before. It <i>is</i> hard, with no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
support but a high purpose, to live against every species
of social opposition.... I <i>should</i> like a little fun now
and then. Life is altogether too sober.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
The utter loneliness of life became intolerable,
and in October of 1854 I took a little orphan girl
from the great emigrant depôt of Randall’s Island
to live with me. This congenial child I finally
adopted. The wisdom of such adoption is abundantly
shown by an entry in my journal, two years
later, written on my birthday:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>

On this bright Sunday morning I feel full of hope and
strength for the future. Kitty plays beside me with her
doll. She has just given me a candy basket, purchased
with a penny she had earned, full of delight in ‘Doctor’s
birthday’! Who will ever guess the restorative support
which that poor little orphan has been to me? When I
took her to live with me she was about seven and a half
years old. I desperately needed the change of thought
she compelled me to give her. It was a dark time, and
she did me good—her genial, loyal, Irish temperament
suited me. Now I look forward with much hope to the
coming events of this year.
</p>
</div><!-- blockquot -->

<p>
An amusing circumstance relating to this child
is worth recording. She had always been accustomed
to call me ‘Doctor.’ On one occasion she
was present during the visit of a friendly physician.
After he was gone, she came to me with a very
puzzled face, exclaiming, ‘Doctor, how very odd it
is to hear a <i>man</i> called Doctor!’
</p>

<p>
In December of 1855 I gave a first drawing-room
‘Address on the Medical Education of Women.’
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In this address (which was afterwards printed)
it was shown that the movement was only a revival
of work in which women had always been engaged;
but that it was a revival in an advanced form, suited
to the age and to the enlarging capabilities of
women.
</p>

<p>
The clear perception of the providential call to
women to take their full share in human progress
has always led us to insist upon a full and identical
medical education for our students. From the beginning
in America, and later on in England, we
have always refused to be tempted by the specious
offers urged upon us to be satisfied with partial or
specialised instruction. On the occasion of this
address an appeal was made for assistance in collecting
funds for the growth of the dispensary and the
gradual formation of a hospital, as indispensable for
the accomplishment of the work. A committee of
three ladies was appointed at this drawing-room
meeting, for the purpose of beginning the difficult
work of collecting a permanent fund.
</p>

<p>
In 1854, my sister, Dr. Emily Blackwell, who
had graduated with honour at the Medical College of
Cleveland, Ohio, was pursuing her studies in Europe.
</p>

<p>
There she gained invaluable surgical experience
from having been generously received as assistant
by Sir James Simpson in his extensive practice in
female diseases. The genial character of this well-known
physician was shown not only by his cordial
reception of Dr. Emily as pupil and assistant, but
by an amusing incident which occurred whilst his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
consulting-rooms were filled by a waiting assembly
of aristocratic patients. My sister, being a classical
scholar, was often employed by the Doctor in making
translations or extracts for him. On one occasion,
whilst thus engaged in the farthest room of the suite,
he called in a low voice, ‘Dr. Blackwell,’ then a
little louder, ‘<i>Dr. Blackwell</i>,’ and when the attention
of all his patients was thus aroused, he called in a
voice loud enough for my sister to hear, ‘<span class="smcap">Dr. Blackwell</span>!’
and then from the corner of his eye, and
with intense amusement, he watched the varied expressions
of surprise and dismay depicted on the
countenances of his distinguished patients as they
saw the approach along the suite of rooms of a lady
who thus answered to the summons.
</p>

<p>
The following letters to my medical sister refer
to this period of the work:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">

New York: May 12.
</p>

<p>
I need not tell you with what interest and hope I look
forward to your Edinburgh news. The prospect is very
good.... One of the most difficult points I have to
contend with here is the entire absence of medical sympathy;
the medical solitude is really awful at times; I
should thankfully turn to any educated woman if I could
find one.... Pray bear in mind to collect all the information
you can about maternity, the relation of the sexes,
and kindred subjects. We have a vast field to work in
this direction, for reliable information is desperately
needed in the world on these topics. I feel as if it were
peculiarly our duty to meet this want. There is much
vain thought given to these matters here. An active set
of people are making desperate efforts to spread their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
detestable doctrines of ‘free love’ under scientific guise,
placing agents with the advertisements of their books
worded in the most specious and attractive manner at the
doors of the conventions now being held here; on the
other hand, equally misleading publications are brought
out in opposition. Such teaching is utterly superficial
and untrustworthy, and consequently misleading. We
want facts, scientifically accurate observations, past and
present, on all that bears on these matters.
</p>

<p>
You remember the pamphlet sent me by Dr. Sims of
Alabama. He is now here, determined to establish a
hospital for the special treatment of women’s diseases;
he is enlisting much support, and will, I think, succeed.
He seems to be in favour of women studying medicine.
I think I shall help him in any way I can....
</p>

<p>
I have at last found a student in whom I can take
a great deal of interest—Marie Zackrzewska, a German,
about twenty-six. Dr. Schmidt, the head of the Berlin
midwifery department, discovered her talent, advised her
to study, and finally appointed her as chief midwife in
the hospital under him; there she taught classes of
about 150 women and 50 young men, and proved herself
most capable. When Dr. Schmidt died, the American
Minister advised her to come to New York; but here the
German doctors wanted her to become a nurse. In
desperation she consulted ‘The Home for the Friendless,’
where they advised her to come to me. There is
true stuff in her, and I shall do my best to bring it out.
She must obtain a medical degree....
</p>


<p class="letter_head">
July 24.
</p>

<p>
Don’t be discouraged. There is no doubt about
our losing many opportunities because of our sex, but you
must also bear in mind the disadvantages all students
labour under, unless in exceptional cases. Crowded
together in masses, they only see at a distance the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
interesting cases; the complete study is reserved for
the physician or his constant attendant. I remember
expressing my impatience while in the Maternité at the
restrictive rules there, and M. Blot said, ‘What you wish
for are only enjoyed by the few who occupy the most
favoured positions.’ Yet I gained, in spite of all difficulties,
a great deal, and in accelerating ratio the longer I
stayed. I remember that it seemed to me I had gained
more in my fourth month at the Maternité than in the
whole three preceding ones. Now I say this because I
don’t want you to over-estimate the worth of pantaloons.
Disguise in France or elsewhere would by no means give
you all you need; if the disguise were complete you
would just be reduced to the level of the common poor
student, and would be, I think, quite disappointed. It
needs also that influential men should take an interest
in you, and give you chances quite beyond the ordinary
run. I know that at St. Bartholomew’s I would not have
exchanged my position for that of the simple student,
though I would gladly for the clinical clerk or <i>interne’s</i>
position. Now you can do nothing in France, except by
special medical influence. Your time is limited, and you
cannot wait for examinations and promotions as an
ordinary student. You ask me what I did, and what can
be done as a lady. I entered the Maternité, dissected at
l’Ecole des Beaux-Arts alone, employed a <i>répétiteur</i> who
drilled me in anatomy and smuggled me into the dead-house
of La Charité at great risk of detection, where I
operated on the <i>cadavre</i>. I once made the rounds of his
wards in the Hôtel-Dieu with Roux, heard his lectures,
and saw his operations. I attended lectures on medical
generalities at the College of France and Jardin des
Plantes. I believe that was all in the way of Parisian
study. I applied to Davenne, Director-General of the
hospitals, for permission to follow the physicians—refused;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
applied to Dubois and Trousseau to attend lectures
at the Ecole de Médecine—refused; Trousseau
advising me to disguise. You see I had no introductions,
no experience. I went into the Maternité soon after
going to France, and came out with a sad accident, not
inclined to renew the battle, not well knowing how, and
with a promising chance opened to me in London. I
should do differently now. I should get the most influential
introduction I could; I should tell them just what
I wanted, find which hospitals would be most suited to
my purpose, and if by putting on disguise I could get
either an assistant’s post or good visiting privilege, I
would put it on. I don’t believe it would be a disguise
at all to those you were thrown with, but it would be a
protection if advised by intelligent men, and would make
them free to help you. I should avoid crowds, because
you gain nothing in them; I don’t think either the lectures
at l’Ecole de Médecine or the great hospital visits,
where from one to five hundred students follow, would
be of any use. It is in a more private and intimate way,
and in hospitals where many students do not go, that you
might gain. I know no one in a position to give you
more valuable letters than Dr. Simpson, if he is disposed
to. You ask me what I saw at the Maternité, but I find
my notes imperfect; I have only noted down nine versions,
&amp;c. But I think the most important thing in the
Maternité is the drilling in the more ordinary labours,
for only where the finger is thoroughly trained can you
detect varieties. The cases you send me are very
interesting, and I am very glad you have made such full
notes, as they will be useful hints in future solitary practice.
Don’t be in a hurry to leave Dr. S., for I fear you
will nowhere else find a good drilling in that department.
I shall see how far I can make your notes available from
time to time in my own practice. With regard to my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
own <i>clientèle</i>, I shall have advanced 50 dollars over last
year; slow progress, but still satisfactory, as it is reliable
practice, not capricious success. Only think, the thermometer
has been up to 102 in some of the rooms down town!
We have had three days’ ‘spells’ this July that seem to

I shall be very anxious to know what you do in Paris.
I almost doubt the propriety of your entering the Maternité,
or rather I hope that the necessity may be obviated
by your finding other openings. That Dubois is somewhat
of an old fox, and will, I presume, at once advise your entrance,
to get rid of any responsibility; but I would not
think of doing so until I had seen all the others and tried
for better openings. I think you could get sufficient midwifery
at the Ecole de Médecine, where the midwives have
the night cases; the association would be unpleasant from
the character of the women, but it would leave you your
freedom. You have done excellently in Edinburgh, and
nothing could be more satisfactory than the way you leave.
I think, however, before going to Paris you had certainly
better see Dr. Oldham of Guy’s; he is disposed to be
friendly, and if he chose might greatly help you. It
would seem as if it would be well to pursue your English
studies before the Parisian; if you could follow Doctors
Burrows and Baly in medicine at St. Bartholomew’s,
and Oldham at Guy’s, you would do well. I am very
glad you are collecting special medical statistics; we
shall find them very serviceable in lecture or pamphlet
form. It will be necessary next year to make an active
effort for the dispensary, and I think a few lectures would
be very important. My conviction becomes constantly
stronger that you will return, and my plans for the future
all involve that fact. A pleasant circumstance occurred
to my German, Dr. Zackrzewska. I arranged a Cleveland
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
course for her, and she entered two weeks ago; she
met a very friendly reception, and found that Dr. Kirkland
is in correspondence with Professor Müller of Berlin,
and he had mentioned her in some of his letters in such
high terms, that the faculty told her, if she would qualify
herself for examination in surgery and chemistry and
write an English thesis, that they would graduate her
at the end of this term. Of course she is studying with
might and main, and will, I have no doubt, succeed; so
we may reckon on a little group of three next year. That
will be quite encouraging.

I cannot but feel glad that you rejected the urgent
persuasions to go to the Crimea. I cannot say what
going to Russia might have done for you in <i>English</i>
reputation, but for America it would have been sheer
waste of time. I am constantly surprised to see what an
entire non-conductor of enthusiasm the ocean is, and
reputation in England, except in very rare cases, is
utterly unavailing here. The radical differences in
national character, and the eager, youthful nature of this
people, quite prevent full sympathetic transmission of
feeling and recognition of older experience. I am vexed
to think how completely unavailing your Scotch studies
will be in the <i>puffing</i> line, but make yourself really strong,
and we will turn them to the best account in another and
a better way. Don’t forget to bring a full earnest testimonial
from Simpson and from others as you progress.

Your letter came yesterday, giving me an account
of M.’s relapse and the many anxieties you have
suffered lately. I confess to feeling an intense anxiety
about her notwithstanding the hope conveyed in your
letter, and I shall look to the coming of the postman
with dread for the next three weeks lest he should bring
me evil news. You have been pursuing your studies in
a way we did not anticipate the last eight weeks, but
very surely it is not lost time; the responsibilities of such
a case will strengthen you for every future case, and as
an illustration of or commentary on Dr. S.’s practice, I
don’t think it will be lost to you. The whole case from
beginning to end strikes me as a horrid barbarism, but at
the same time I fully allow that it is the way to make a
reputation. M.’s death would be little to him, the
responsibility would be staved off in a dozen different
ways, and if she succeeded in her object, no end to the
trumpeting of his praise! I see every day that it is the
‘heroic,’ self-reliant, and actively <i>self-imposing</i> practitioner
that excites a sensation and reputation; the rational
and conscientious physician is not the famous one.
</p>

<p>
I have just heard one piece of news which decidedly
indicates progress and which is peculiarly cheering to me,
because I am persuaded that I have been chiefly instrumental
in it. The New York Hospital has opened its
doors to women this winter; there is now a class of eight
women, all pupils from Dr. Trall’s hydropathic institute,
who attend regularly the clinical visits and lectures in
the amphitheatre with all the other students. The
matter was discussed in full board, Trimble and Collins
both advocating, and it was resolved to make the experiment,
Drs. Smith, Buck, and Watson, the then attending
physicians, being present and consenting, quite concurring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
in the principle, and only pleading the embarrassment
they should themselves occasionally feel. Mr.
Trimble assured them they would soon conquer their
bashfulness! Thus far, it seems, there has been no
difficulty. I consider the matter so important that I
intend at once to take the hospital ticket and watch the
experiment in person as closely as I can. I only wish
the girls came from other than quack auspices.
</p>

<p>
Do the ‘knockings’ prevail at all in England? it is
astonishing how they increase here. Judge Edmunds
has published two large volumes, which are astonishing, I
think, as a record of self-deception or credulity. The promoters
hold public discussions in the tabernacle, publish
endless literature, and have hired a large house in Broadway
at 2,200 dollars, and Katy Fox at a salary of 1,200 dollars
per annum to give free demonstrations to whoever wishes
to investigate the truth of ‘this wonderful new revelation.’
I attended one of these free sittings lately at Mrs. B.’s
invitation. It was a curious physical phenomenon to my
mind of the animal magnetism order. My few questions
were all answered wrong; but Mrs. B. and many others
asked similar questions, the answers of which she knew,
and they were answered promptly and correctly. Everyone
who queried with eager temperament got prompt and
correct replies, independent of Katy Fox’s volition. It
was odd, but quite disgusting in the view taken of it, as
an ultra-mundane exhibition.

<p>
<i>Establishment of a hospital.</i>—In 1856 my working
powers were more than doubled by the arrival
of my sister, Dr. Emily Blackwell, who became
henceforth my partner and able co-worker. Dr.
Maria E. Zackrzewska also joined us as soon as she
had graduated at Cleveland, and became for some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
years before her removal to Boston our active and
valued assistant in the New York work.
</p>

<p>
The refreshing Sunday walks taken with this
warm-hearted doctor when, crossing the bay by an
early ferry-boat, we walked for hours in the beautiful
environs of Hoboken or Staten Island, will always
remain as a pleasant background to the affectionate
friendship which still continues.
</p>

<p>
Thus reinforced, an advanced step was made in
1857 by the renting of a house, No. 64 Bleecker
Street, which we fitted up for a hospital where both
patients and young assistant physicians could be
received. This institution, under the name of ‘The
New York Infirmary for Women and Children,’ was
formally opened in the May of this year by a public
meeting, in which the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher,
Dr. Elder of Philadelphia, and the Rev. Dr. Tyng,
jun., warmly supported the movement. In this
institution Dr. Zackrzewska accepted the post of
resident physician, Dr. Emily becoming chiefly
responsible for the surgical practice.
</p>

<p>
This first attempt to establish a hospital conducted
entirely by women excited much opposition.
At that date, although college instruction was being
given to women students in some places, no hospital
was anywhere available either for practical instruction
or the exercise of the woman-physician’s skill.
To supply the need had become a matter of urgent
importance. Our difficulties are thus noted in the
Annual Report for 1864:—
</p>

<p>
‘But to this step (the establishment of a hospital)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
a host of objections were raised by those whom the
early friends of the institution attempted to interest
in their effort. They were told that no one would
let a house for the purpose, that female doctors
would be looked upon with so much suspicion that
the police would interfere; that if deaths occurred
their death certificates would not be recognised;
that they would be resorted to by classes and
persons whom it would be an insult to be called
upon to deal with; that without men as resident
physicians they would not be able to control the
patients; that if any accident occurred, not only
the medical profession but the public would blame
the trustees for supporting such an undertaking;
and, finally, that they would never be able to collect
money enough for so unpopular an effort.’
</p>

<p>
Through a cloud of discouragement and distrust
the little institution steadily worked its way, its few
friends holding to it the more firmly for the difficulties
it experienced. The practice of the infirmary,
both medical and surgical, was conducted entirely
by women; but a board of consulting physicians,
men of high standing in the profession, gave it
the sanction of their names. Dr. Valentine Mott,
Dr. John Watson, Drs. Willard Parker, R. S.
Kissam, Isaac E. Taylor, and George P. Camman
were the earliest medical friends of the infirmary.
</p>

<p>
The pecuniary support of this institution, in
addition to the medical responsibility involved in its
conduct, was no small burden. For many years its
annual income rested mainly on our exertions. A
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
bazaar was held in its behalf for seven years in
succession; lectures, concerts, and every other
available means of collecting funds were resorted to.
</p>

<p>
At one time Fanny Kemble was giving a series
of Shakespearian readings in New York, and often
rendered generous help to benevolent institutions by
the use of her great talent. We hoped that she
might aid our struggling infirmary by giving a public
reading in its behalf. So on one occasion I called
with our fellow-worker Dr. Zackrzewska at the
hotel where she was staying to prefer our request.
She received us courteously, listened with kindness
to an explanation of the object of our visit and of
the needs of the infirmary; but when she heard
that the physicians of the institution were <i>women</i>
she sprang up to her full height, turned her flashing
eyes upon us, and with the deepest tragic tones of
her magnificent voice exclaimed: ‘Trust <i>a woman</i>—as
a <span class="smcap">doctor</span>!—NEVER!’
</p>

<p>
The thunder-clap which thus smote us in the
New York hotel brought back amusingly to my
mind the scene at Brighton, when the parlour door
suddenly opened, and a brilliant figure in stage
costume advanced to the gentle, refined Lady Byron
with an impassioned quotation from ‘Julius Cæsar.’
The contrast between two women’s natures was so
remarkable!
</p>

<p>
The necessity, however, of a separate hospital
for the general training of women students had by
this time been recognised. Experience both at the
New York Hospital and at the large Bellevue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
Hospital, where classes of imperfectly trained women
had failed to maintain their ground, proved that a
special woman’s centre was needed, not only as
affording them practical instruction, but for the
purpose of testing the capacity and tact of the
students themselves, before admitting them to walk
the general hospitals where male students were
admitted. The New York Infirmary for Women
therefore gradually enlisted the active help of enlightened
men and women.
</p>

<p>
We were much encouraged by the kindly contributions
of articles for our annual bazaars from
English friends; and a generous-hearted French
lady, Madame Trélat, who felt much interest in
the new medical movement, sent a donation to
the funds of the hospital. The continued interest
of English friends is shown by our correspondence.

work, or the absolute necessity which lies upon us to
live out the ideal life to the utmost of our power. My

of humanity, and is necessarily difficult of appreciation
by the mass of people, and is very slow in gaining
their esteem. It has been a most toilsome lesson to
translate my thought into the common language of life.
I labour at this translation perpetually, and still remain too
often incomprehensible. I will not degrade the central
thought of this work, but I seek in every way to accommodate

CHAPTER VI
<br />
<span  class="subhead">
ENGLAND REVISITED<br />
1858
</span>
</h2>

<p>
The ten years during which this pioneer medical
work had been steadily carried on had thus firmly
established the new departure as a useful innovation
in the United States. The reform was at that time
steadily growing, not only in New York, but also in
Philadelphia and Boston, under the guidance of able
bodies of women. We were now desirous of learning
what openings existed in England for the entrance of
women into the medical profession. We knew that
much interest had been felt there in the progress
of the American work, and we had been urged by
friends in Europe to give some account of it.
</p>

<p>
It was determined, therefore, in August 1858
that I should again revisit my native land and urge
the importance of this medical work. Soon after
my arrival in Europe I took the occasion of a visit
made to a sister in Paris to prepare carefully a series
of three addresses to be delivered in England, showing
what was being done in medicine by women in
the United States, and the reasons for that work.
The first of these addresses was on the value of
physiological knowledge to women, the second on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
the value of medical knowledge, and the third on the
practical aspect of the work as established in America
and its adaptability to England. Whilst engaged in
the preparation of the lectures I entered into relations
with the large-hearted Countess de Noailles,
whose devotion to sanitary reform and generous support
of benevolent enterprises were equally remarkable.
This lady was very desirous that a country
sanatorium for women should be established in
England or France, being firmly convinced that
hygienic conditions in their fullest application were
the chief necessity in the successful treatment of
special diseases. This lady wrote to an old friend in
Paris: ‘I wish to direct all my efforts to this object.
Let me know as soon as possible what it would cost
to establish a small hospital for women and children
either in France or England, under Miss Blackwell’s
direction.’ She also requested one of her noble
French relatives to make my acquaintance. The
interview is thus described in a letter to Dr. Emily
in New York.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
Paris: 1858.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I saw Madame —— by appointment at her
own house. A. says she is a daughter of the Prince de
P.; to me she seemed a stout, black-eyed Frenchwoman
of forty-five, cordial in manner, speaking English well,
and knowing as much of England and Anglo-Saxon nature
as a Frenchwoman ever can know. We conversed energetically
for two hours. She is seriously interested in the
entrance of women into the medical profession, a wish
founded in her case on the moral degradation which she
has observed amongst her own acquaintance from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
practice of being treated by men in female complaints.
The fact which most struck her in all I told her was your
amputating a breast; in this she actually triumphed. Her
face became radiant with the intense satisfaction of the
thing, for it proved to her by a fact what she wanted to
believe, but could only accept intellectually from all
my reasons—viz. the necessity of letting the midwife
drop, and striking unflinchingly for the highest position.
This one fact, worth to this sort of nature a host of arguments,
gave her real faith in the physician. She opened
freely her objections, or rather difficulties, and I met
them one after another; and this difference I observed in
the encounter with the cultivated European nature—when
I gave her a reason she understood it and accepted it; it
did not go in at one ear and out at the other as with
more frivolous people; there is some soil or substance
you can plant in in this stouter nature. As years ago
with Lady Byron, so with this lady, it was of some use
talking to her. She propounded, of course, foolish as
well as serious ideas; thus she thought that women
physicians should never marry; she also would be shocked
to see me with a garland on my head dancing in a ball-room,
and she thought they should be devoted, like the
sisters of charity, &amp;c. I combated her idea of abnegation
for a while, and put in a feeler to see if she could take
in a higher notion; but finding it was impossible, I at once
ceased the attempt, and allowed her to hold to her own
highest idea, which I could see was tinged by her French
nature. Of course it wearied me a little, and I wanted
after a while to expand my lungs and breathe freely;
but I certainly made a strong impression upon her. She
thanked me and shook my hand again and again at parting,
and said that she should not think of letting this be
our last interview, and she should write to Madame de
Noailles the very next day. She had asked me previously
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
if I was resolved in any case to go back to America, and
I had told her ‘No,’ but described at the same time the
excellent beginning we had made there. I feel convinced
that I shall have some proposition in relation to my (or
rather our) establishment in London. What, then, ought
we to say should such an offer arise? I will accept
nothing that is not offered to us both, on that I am quite
determined; we cannot separate in practice.

Preparing my lectures is a troublesome business. My
first one would not do; it was so much more adapted to
an American than an English audience. I wanted also
quantities of facts that I did not know how to get. But
I have now re-written twenty-one pages. I have written
it with pleasure, though very slowly, and I am really surprised
to find how very slowly I write. I can only write
when I feel fresh in the morning; sometimes only a page,
sometimes none. I will not force it when I don’t feel

It was during this visit that I had the privilege

the head of La Salpêtrière, and his admirable wife,
who remained steadfast friends through life. I visited
them at La Salpêtrière—that large asylum for infirm
women, over which Dr. Trélat presided with truly
paternal care. La Salpêtrière was not then a great
school of experimentation, but a benevolent refuge,
where the well-being and kindly protection of its
inmates formed the primary object of the director.

I have heard with great pleasure of an invitation to

France <i>en route</i> for Mentone. My old friend’s health is
failing from the pressure of mental labour. I cannot go
into the details of her last five years now, but the labour
has been and is immense. I think I have never known
a woman labour as she has done. It is a most remarkable
experience; she indeed deserves the name of a worker.
Of course we conversed very earnestly about the nursing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
plan in which she wished to interest me. She says that
for six months she shall be utterly unable to give any
thought to the fund work, and wants me meanwhile to
observe English life very carefully, and make up my mind
as to whether I can give up America, which she thinks a
very serious matter. Unfortunately she does not think
private practice possible in connection with her plan. If
so, it would be impossible for us to help her. She thinks
her own health will never permit her to carry out her
plan herself, and I much fear she is right in this belief.

<p>
After a short visit to the Riviera, to confer with
the Countess de Noailles about her proposed sanatorium
for women, I returned to London. There my
warm friends the Misses Leigh Smith, supported by
their generous-hearted father, and Miss Bessie Rayner
Parkes, interested themselves actively in preparing
for the first delivery of my lectures. The Marylebone
Hall was secured. Our young friends brought
up primroses and other lovely flowers and green
wreaths from Hastings to ornament the reading-desk,
and warmly supported me by their ardent
sympathy. On March 2, 1859, the first lecture was
given to a very intelligent and appreciative audience,
whose interest was warmly enlisted. I well remember
the tears rolling down the benevolent face of Miss
Anna Goldsmid, who sat immediately in front of me.
But the most important listener was the bright,
intelligent young lady whose interest in the study
of medicine was then aroused—Miss Elizabeth
Garrett—who became the pioneer of the medical
movement in England, and who, as Mrs. Garrett
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>

These addresses were afterwards given in Manchester,
Birmingham, and Liverpool; Mr. Bracebridge
kindly making arrangements for them in
Birmingham and the Rev. W. H. Channing in
Liverpool.
</p>

<p>
The interest thus excited in London led to some
effort being made to commence in England similar
work to that being done in America. A meeting of
ladies was held at the St. John’s Wood residence of
Mrs. Peter Taylor, over which Mr. William Shaen
presided. A committee was formed to consider the
subject, and encouraged by the offer of help made by
the Countess de Noailles, a circular was prepared,
stating the object to be accomplished and inviting
support. This circular, which was revised by Dr.
Mayo, Lady Byron, Mr. Shaen, and the Hon. Russell
Gurney, was gradually signed by a large number of
influential ladies.

<i>Proposed Hospital for the Treatment of the
Special Diseases of Women</i>
</p>

<p>
The Lectures recently delivered by Doctor Elizabeth
Blackwell at the Marylebone Literary Institution have
produced in the minds of the ladies who heard them a
strong conviction of the necessity for a more general
diffusion of hygienic knowledge among women; and have
led to a proposition to found a hospital for a class of
diseases, the ordinary treatment of which too frequently
involves much avoidable moral suffering, to be placed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
under the direction of competent women physicians, in
connection with a Board of consulting physicians and
surgeons.
</p>

<p>
A lady, impressed with the want of such an institution,
and convinced of the value of hygienic knowledge
in the treatment and prevention of female diseases, has
already promised 1,000<i>l.</i> towards the hospital, and offers
5,000<i>l.</i> more for the endowment of a Sanitary Professorship
in connection with it, provided a sufficient sum be
raised by donation to place the institution on a permanent
basis.
</p>

<p>
In order to secure the advantages of this offer, it is
proposed to raise and invest an additional sum of not less

The more I see of work in England, the more I
like it. From the Queen downwards I see signs of
favour. On all hands we make converts, and those
who are indoctrinated make converts. The whole
way in which the cause is regarded by laity and
doctors is most respectful. I believe we could get into
general practice. We could shape the whole matter in
the right way, for people welcome true ideas. There is
an immense charm in this fresh field, where solid English
heads receive the highest view of truth, where generosity
and largeness of idea meet you at every turn. I like
working and living in England, and there is no limit to
what we might accomplish here. But, alas! there is the
same old difficulty. We ought to have an independent
300<i>l.</i> per annum between us, and for want of that it is all
vitiated. I see the charm of work here as clearly as I
did on my arrival nine months ago, and feel immeasurably
more hopeful about the possibilities of English work, but
I realise more than ever the difficulty of working here
upon nothing. I am writing to you upon our last prospectus,
one which is to be widely circulated when we
are satisfied with the names appended. It has been carefully
revised, and it is contemplated to distribute many
thousands of them. But we have been six weeks shaping
the prospectus and collecting some names, and I know
that it will take many weeks more to secure the names it
is hoped to obtain. In fact, it is a long work of initiation
that has to be carried on, which would be very thorough,
excellently well done, but which I cannot wait to do.

It is very unfortunate that the probable dissolution of

various testimonials of English and Continental study
given by distinguished physicians and credentials of
American practice to the Medical Council. On this
council, of which Sir Benjamin Brodie was president,
were old friends of the St. Bartholomew’s days.
The subject was very carefully considered, and after
mature deliberation this just and important concession
to qualified women was authorised. I had the
satisfaction of being enrolled as a recognised physician

My letter this week must be rather short, for I
am overwhelmed with all sorts of engagements previous
to leaving for Birmingham, where I give my
first provincial lecture next Monday. I have communicated
to our little committee Madame de Noailles’s
insistence upon a country site for the hospital, and also
the necessity that exists for not abandoning our work in
New York until the institutions there are self-supporting.
They are very much disappointed by the country condition
attached to the hospital; but were I settled in England
and working there, it would not discourage them. But
all our friends seem to think that as the New York Infirmary
is the best argument that can be used for English
work, its downfall would be an irreparable misfortune,
and they are willing, under the circumstances, to let me go.
Indeed, I find it necessary to come to a decision myself,
and after carefully weighing everything I have made up my
mind to return, at any rate for some time. I can secure
any amount of personal interest from various quarters;
but as the prospect of speedily realising an institution
where we could both work is put farther off, I do not
wish to stay under the circumstances....

A letter just received from the Countess de Noailles
urges me to begin a sanatorium in the country near New
York. She says: ‘As the central hospital already
exists in New York, if you will allow me to help in
beginning a sanatorium in country air I should be
able to realise my idea at once. I think you might
obtain some house or farmhouse for the purpose in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
course of the autumn or spring. The importance of convalescent
hospitals in the country is beginning to be
recognised in England; let women be the first to set the
example of one in America. I believe that in women’s
complaints they are of more importance than in any
other, and that in seven cases out of ten the air alone
would effect the cure.’ Now I think this is extremely
rational and liberal, and we must discuss together how
we can do it for her.

<p>
It grieves me much to know of these constantly recurring
illnesses, crippling so valuable a life. What a
satire it is to call our science ‘The Art of Healing’!
</p>

<p>
My provincial trip has been very interesting to me, as
bringing me into contact with a great number of people
in different classes of society, showing me everywhere a
great want and an eager reception of what I have to give.
From Leeds, Nottingham, and Edinburgh came earnest
invitations to lecture. A message sent to my sister from
Edinburgh stated a total revolution in womanly sentiment,
and that her reception would now be as hearty as it was
formerly hostile. A student from Cambridge told me the
young men were warmly in our favour.
</p>

<p>
Mothers beg me for instruction in health. Young
ladies listen eagerly to the idea of work. Three desired
to become medical students. Wise old physicians ask
me to ‘break up’ certain fashionable London practices
by substituting our own practice. Thus from many
different points of view a deep interest awakens, but
everywhere the London experience was repeated—viz.
<i>conversion</i>; women thinking themselves hostile, but receiving
the idea when they knew what it really meant.
But the sympathy is necessarily intellectual only—practical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
reception and familiarity with the new position of
women must necessarily be of slow growth. It must be,
in fact, a life work. The children of the present generation
will grow up accustomed to women doctors, respecting
and trusting them, but the large majority of the
adults will only hold a half-faith, and this will be a
gradual growth. I am convinced that there would not
be a rapidly brilliant success in England, such as some
enthusiastic friends dream of.
</p>

<p>
There is a call for the work, an admirable field, but
the work itself is a very slow one, the steady conquest of
innumerable difficulties—a creation, in fact. The hospital
scheme I think premature.
</p>

<p>
I had promised to bring it forward, and have done so,
but I believe, to be successful, it must spring, as in
America, out of private practice. I have no faith in its
rapid success.
</p>

<p>
My own opinions and plans, then, may be briefly
summed up.
</p>

<p>
There is a valuable and much-needed work to be done
in England. Slow, uphill work, not remunerative (my
tour was an expense to me); a repetition, to a great extent,
of our last seven years’ work. It would need us
both to do it well; and so greatly does England want
just our experience that, were it possible, I should counsel
the transference of our work to this side of the water.
But this we cannot do, and I shall therefore endeavour
to prepare others for English work by receiving and
educating students in America. In America, as here, it
is a life work. I shall go back to create the institutions
of which we have planted only the little germ. In ten
years’ time we may hope for permanent institutions
there, worthy of their object, but we can during that time
efficiently aid earnest young Englishwomen for their
work here. Mrs. Bracebridge, who is much interested
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
in this plan, is coming to London in Trinity Week for
the special purpose of becoming acquainted with Mrs.
Gurney and Mrs. Battin. They will form a committee
for appointing and testing students. There will be a
good deal of work connected with these arrangements,
but directly it is completed I leave, as I am much wanted
across the water.
</p>

<p>
I shall see you, my dear friend, before I leave (about
June 25). I shall be sad to say good-bye, but I know
that distance will not necessarily part us.

Returning to New York in August 1859, I found
the permanent fund which had been commenced for
the purchase of a hospital site prospering. The
steady friends of the movement—Stacy B. Collins,
Robert Haydock, Merritt Trimble, and Samuel Willets,
formed the nucleus of an earnest band of supporters,
both men and women. The spacious house,
126 Second Avenue, was purchased and adapted to
the use of hospital and dispensary, with accommodation
for several students.
</p>

<p>
Our able fellow-worker, Dr. Zackrzewska, having
left us to superintend the new hospital in Boston,
we carried on the rapidly growing work of the
infirmary with the aid of intelligent graduates from
Philadelphia, who came to us for practical instruction
in medicine.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the usual departments of hospital
and dispensary practice, which included the visiting
of poor patients at their own homes, we established
a sanitary visitor. This post was filled by one of
our assistant physicians, whose special duty it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
to give simple, practical instruction to poor mothers
on the management of infants and the preservation
of the health of their families. An intelligent young
coloured physician, Dr. Cole, who was one of our
resident assistants, carried on this work with tact
and care. Experience of its results serve to show
that the establishment of such a department would
be a valuable addition to every hospital.
</p>

<p>
Correspondence with English friends continued,
and we were deeply interested by the following
letters from Miss Elizabeth Garrett, who was
bravely commencing the necessary pioneer work in
England:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Aldeburgh, Suffolk: January 2, 1861.
</p>

<p>
I feel anxious to tell you how very much I enjoy the
work and study, as this is to a great extent unexpected to
me. As I had not any very strong interest in the subjects,
and was led to choose the profession more from a strong
conviction of its fitness for women than from any absorbing
personal bias, I was prepared to find the first
year’s preparation work tedious and wearing. That this
has not been the case is, I believe, mainly due to the fact
of my having access to the hospital practice, which acts
as a continual aid and stimulus to study. For three
months I attended as a probationary nurse, learning what
I could both from the doctors and nurses, and reading in
the spare moments. It was, however, very difficult to
make way in this desultory manner. The temptation to
discursiveness and want of system met me continually,
and at last I determined to begin the study of anatomy,
chemistry, and materia medica, working steadily at these
and enduring the ignorance of other branches which could
not be studied rightly till a foundation of this kind had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
laid. In pursuance of this plan, when the three months’
nursing had expired I had an interview with the treasurer
of the hospital, and asked permission to visit the wards
and go round with the house doctors. This Mr. De
Morgan agreed to, and also suggested that Mr. Plaskitt,
the apothecary, should be asked to take me as a pupil in
the dispensary, which I found him very willing to do.
Mr. De Morgan, however, will hold out no hope of my
being admitted as a regular student, and the general feeling
seems to be that each doctor is willing to help me
privately and singly, but they are afraid to countenance
the movement by helping me in their collective capacity.
This will, however, come in time, I trust, and in the
meantime it is a great thing to meet with so much individual
courtesy and help. When I left the special nursing
work, Dr. Willis, the house physician, offered to superintend
my reading in private lessons at my own house,
which was precisely the kind of help I was most glad to
accept. I continue to go to the hospital early, and go
round the female medical wards alone, making notes of
all difficulties and writing descriptions of heart and chest
sounds and diagnosing as well as I can. This occupies
the time till Dr. Willis comes, when I go round again and
consult him upon all doubtful points, and learn a great
deal by observing his method and principles. After this
I go into the dispensary for two or three hours and learn
the Pharmacopœia practically, and spend the afternoon in
study in a room which the authorities have kindly lent me
in the hospital. I am to continue on my present footing
till April, but beyond that time I have no very clear plans.
I wish to get all the education that is possible in London,
even if it must be of a private or irregular kind. Perhaps
it would be best to call upon Dr. Southwood Smith, Dr.
Mayo, and Dr. Jenner, and hear if they can help me into
any other medical school.

22 Manchester Square: May 8, 1862.
</p>

<p>
I have delayed writing, hoping that I might have at
last some good news of success to give you; now, as this
seems farther off than I had hoped it would be, I will delay
no longer. I think Mrs. Russell Gurney wrote you that I
was spending all my time just now in preparing for the
matriculation examination of the University of London.
I decided to make this the first step, in consequence of the
experience last summer brought us. We then made three
very careful and vigorous efforts to gain the admission of
women into a medical school. Those we tried were the
Middlesex, the Westminster, and the London Hospitals;
and early in this year we attempted the Grosvenor Street
School. I need not tell you we were in each case unsuccessful,
though in one or two cases the adverse decision
was gained by a very small majority of votes. In each
case those gentlemen who opposed always urged as one
ground for their doing so, that as the examining bodies
were not prepared to admit women to their examinations,
the school could not educate a woman to be an illegal
practitioner, and that by doing so they would incur the
certain risk of injuring the school in the eyes of the public
without really aiding women. The medical papers also
took up the same line. The ‘Lancet’ was particularly
anxious to point out that we were beginning at the wrong
end, and that the first thing we should do was to settle
the question of examination. I also had private information
from several of the lecturers at the Middlesex that if
I could matriculate at the London University and enter
as a medical student for its examinations, my friends at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
their school would do all they could to get the adverse
decision there altered. I therefore applied to the Apothecaries’
Hall and to the College of Surgeons, asking the
latter body if they would allow me to compete for the
special diploma for midwifery which they now give. This
was refused, with an intimation that the College would not
in any way countenance the introduction of ladies into
the medical profession. The application to the Hall was
more fortunate; the question turned on a legal technicality,
and was referred to counsel and finally decided in my
favour. I must, of course, conform to all the ordinary
regulations, but when I have done so I can obtain the
licence to practise granted by that body. One of the
regulations I have met without difficulty—viz. being apprenticed
to a medical man for five years before the final
examination. I had indentures made out as soon as I
knew the decision. The second one (spending three years
in a medical school in the United Kingdom) is more difficult:
it is something to be able to say when applying for
admission into a school that the Hall would examine me
and give me its licence. Still, as the licence is not all
that I want, I thought it better to make an effort at some
university for the M.D. For many reasons it seems desirable
to make the attempt at the London University.
The medical examinations there are exceedingly good;
the constitution of the body is of the most liberal description,
and no residence is required nor any teaching given,
so that the students would not be brought into any kind
of contact till they met in the examination-room. Students
of all kinds (whatever degree they may ultimately
desire to take) are required to pass the matriculation
examination in arts, and this includes the classics,
natural philosophy, and mathematics, besides a modern
language and the ordinary school subjects, history and
geography, and is altogether an examination which would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
require a more liberal and careful education (in the case
of girls) than is now generally given, even if the candidates
never went in for the M.A. or B.A. degree. It was
clear that the only chance of obtaining admission to the
examinations generally lay in keeping the question on
the widest, most general ground, advocating the claims of
governesses and other women who required a good general
examination, without introducing the question of medical
degrees or the admission of women to any new professions.
The university is about to have a new charter, and we
therefore thought that this was the time to raise the question
by praying the Senate to obtain the insertion of a
clause expressly extending to women the benefits of their
examinations. Before doing this we had submitted the
present charter to the Attorney-General, and had had his
opinion upon the power of the Senate to admit women
upon its authority, as it is now drawn up. He thought
they had no power to do so, and therefore there was no
alternative but to ask for a new clause. In order to get
some expression of the general feeling on the question,
circulars similar to the one I send you were extensively
distributed. More than 1,500 were sent out, and as a
result we obtained a very respectable number of names
as allies. Some of their letters were so cordial that we
had extracts printed and sent to the members of the
Senate with the list of names. The Vice-Chancellor and
Mr. Grote were throughout most kindly ready to help us,
and to give the proposal the full weight of their influence.
The discussion at the Senate came on yesterday, and was
a most lengthened and animated one; of twenty-one
members present, ten were for, ten against, and one neutral.
The Chancellor (Lord Granville) then had the casting-vote,
and gave it against us.
</p>

<p>
I am exceedingly sorry, as this would have been
fraught with such great benefit to many different classes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
of women, and would, I think, have been just the encouragement
needed by girls when they leave school to
keep them interested in their studies and out of the
merely fashionable or domestic life they are so liable to
fall into. It would also have been a great encouragement
to parents, and would have made them more willing to
let their daughters have time and opportunity for culture
after they leave the schoolroom. These advantages would
have been widely felt, and for professional women, whether
governesses or physicians, the opportunity of being able
to take a degree would have been invaluable. However,
it is not to be had now; perhaps, when they are having
another charter eight or ten years hence, we may try
again and succeed. I do not imagine there is much
chance of being able to do more at any other university
in the United Kingdom than we can do here, so that I
fear the possibility of ever obtaining an English degree
as M.D. is a very remote one.
</p>

<p>
My notion now is to try to get into a school and
obtain the Apothecaries’ Hall licence. If this should
prove possible, it would occupy between three and four
years from next October. I should then wish to come to
America and obtain the M.D. there, and then spend a
year in Paris. I should be glad to know if you think I
ought to make a point of getting the best M.D. diploma I
can, either in America or on the Continent, if it should
prove impossible to obtain one here, and if I <i>can</i> get the
Apothecaries’ licence. My own feeling is in favour of
having the M.D.; though it should be a foreign one, I
believe it would command more respect than the licence
from the Hall would alone. I am fortunately able to
choose to do whatever is most advisable, as I need not
be in a hurry to enter upon the profession from pecuniary
or any other motives, and I think I cannot aid the cause
more soundly than by trying to do everything in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
most thorough and exact way. It would be well, I
think, to spend a good deal of time and strength on
getting the very best diploma or certificate open to
women. Should it prove to be quite impossible to get
into a school, the licence from the Hall would not be
within my reach. I must, in this case, rely entirely on
foreign diplomas and on American schools. I shall not
be too ready to admit this necessity, as I fear the advantage
to the cause would be greatly diminished by the
fact of my being educated in America.
</p>

<p>
I should be very glad to spend a year with you in the
infirmary after having studied in a school here, but I
should be very sorry to give up my English friends and
interests for the whole period of study, if it can by any
means be avoided. Still, if it cannot, I am ready to go
on with the work. The time spent in study has been
most pleasant, and I am more than ever convinced both
that this special work is one which a woman may have a
divine right to engage in, and that every single woman’s
life is both happier and more useful if she has an absorbing
interest and pursuit. I shall be very glad to have
your advice, when you can kindly find time to write to

volunteers to the fearful slaughter of civil war, the
concentration of thought and action on the war
dwarfed every other effort.
</p>

<p>
The war was essentially a rebellion by a portion
of the States for the maintenance of slavery. To us,
nourished from childhood on the idea of human
freedom and justice, the contest became of absorbing
interest. Though our American friends often reproached
us as Englishwomen for the action of the
English Government, we threw ourselves energetically
into the cause of freedom.
</p>

<p>
On the outbreak of the war, an informal meeting
of the lady managers was called at the infirmary to
see what could be done towards supplying the want
of trained nurses so widely felt after the first battles.
A notice of this meeting to be held at the infirmary
having accidentally found its way into the ‘New York
Times,’ the parlours of the infirmary were crowded
with ladies, to the surprise of the little group of
managers.
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Dr. Bellows and Dr. Elisha Harris
being present, a formal meeting was organised.
Whilst the great and urgent need of a supply of
nurses was fully recognised, it was also felt that the
movement would be too vast to be carried on by so
small an institution. A letter was therefore drafted
on this occasion, calling for a public meeting at the
Cooper Institute, and a committee of the ladies
present was appointed to obtain signatures to this
call.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The meeting at the Cooper Institute was crowded
to overflowing. The National Sanitary Aid Association
was then formed, in order to organise the
energetic efforts to help that were being made all
over the country.
</p>

<p>
The Ladies’ Sanitary Aid Association, of which
we were active members, was also formed. This
branch worked daily at the Cooper Institute during
the whole of the war. It received and forwarded
contributions of comforts for the soldiers, zealously
sent from the country; but its special work was the
forwarding of nurses to the seat of war. All that
could be done in the extreme urgency of the need
was to sift out the most promising women from the
multitudes that applied to be sent on as nurses, put
them for a month in training at the great Bellevue
Hospital of New York, which consented to receive
relays of volunteers, provide them with a small outfit,
and send them on for distribution to Miss Dix, who was
appointed superintendent of nurses at Washington.
</p>

<p>
The career of one of these nurses, a German,
deserves recording. We hesitated about receiving
her, on account of her excitable disposition, but she
insisted on going. This feeble-looking woman soon
drifted away from the Washington Depôt to the
active service of the front. After the battle of
Gettysburg she spent two days and nights on the
field of slaughter, wading with men’s boots in the
blood and mud, pulling out the still living bodies
from the heaps of slain, binding up hideous wounds,
giving a draught of water to one, placing a rough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
pillow under the head of another, in an enthusiasm
of beneficence which triumphed equally over thought
of self and horror of the hideous slaughter.
</p>

<p>
A welcome relief to the great tension of life
during those years was the visit of Mr. Herman
Bicknell, F.R.C.S., who was travelling in America
after the death of his wife. I remembered him as a
fellow-student of the St. Bartholomew’s days, who
sat by me in the lecture-room; and he recalled many
interesting reminiscences of that eventful time. He
was a man of great though eccentric talent, and a
clever Persian scholar, having resided long in the
East. His cordial friendship during many later
years was much prized, and continued until his
premature death.
</p>

<p>
It was not until this great national rebellion was
ended that the next step in the growth of the
infirmary could be taken.
</p>

<p>
The infirmary service of young assistant physicians,
which had been hitherto supplied by students
whose theoretical training had been obtained elsewhere,
no longer met the New York needs.
</p>

<p>
In 1865 the trustees of the infirmary, finding
that the institution was established in public favour,
applied to the Legislature for a charter conferring
college powers upon it.
</p>

<p>
They took this step by the strong advice of some
of the leading physicians of New York interested in
the infirmary, who urged that the medical education
of women should not be allowed to pass into the
hands of the irresponsible persons who were at that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
time seeking to establish a women’s college in New
York. We took this step, however, with hesitation,
for our own feeling was adverse to the formation of
an entirely separate school for women. The first
women physicians connected with the infirmary,
having all been educated in the ordinary medical
schools, felt very strongly the advantage of admission
to the large organised system of public instruction
already existing for men; and also the benefits
arising from association with men as instructors and
companions in the early years of medical study.
They renewed their efforts, therefore, to induce some
good recognised New York school to admit, under
suitable arrangements, a class of students guaranteed
by the infirmary, rather than add another to the
list of female colleges already existing. Finding,
however, after consultation with the different New
York schools, that such arrangements could not at
present be made, the trustees followed the advice of
their consulting staff, obtained a college charter,
and opened a subscription for a college fund.
</p>

<p>
The use of a spacious lecture-room in the New
York University, on Washington Square, was temporarily
obtained, until the house adjoining the infirmary
could be leased and fitted for college
purposes.<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
</p>

<p>
A full course of college instruction was gradually
organised, with the important improvement of establishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
the subject of hygiene as one of the principal
professorial chairs, thus making it an equal as
well as obligatory study. Another important improvement
adopted was the establishment of an
Examination Board, independent of the teaching
staff, a plan not then customary in the United States.
This Board was composed of some of the best known
members of the profession, and at the same time we
changed the ordinary term of medical study from
three years to four.
</p>

<p>
During the early years of the college I occupied
the Chair of Hygiene, and had the pleasure of welcoming
Miss Jex Blake, then visiting America, as a
member of the first class. The Professor of Hygiene
also superintended the important work of the sanitary
visitor at the homes of the poor. It has always
seemed to me, during many years of active private
practice, that the first and constant aim of the family
physician should be to diffuse the sanitary knowledge
which would enable parents to bring up healthy
children.
</p>

<p>
The most painful experience which I met with in
practice was the death of one of my little patients
from the effects of vaccination. This baby, though
carefully tended and the lymph used guaranteed
pure, died from the phagedenic ulceration set up by
vaccination in a rather scrofulous constitution. To
a hygienic physician thoroughly believing in the
beneficence of Nature’s laws, to have caused the
death of a child by such means was a tremendous
blow!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This serious experience awakened a growing distrust
as to the wisdom of all medical methods which
introduce any degree of morbid matter into the blood
of the human system; a distrust which no amount
of temporary professional opinion or doubtful statistics
has been able to remove. Although I have
always continued to vaccinate when desired, I am
strongly opposed to every form of inoculation of
attenuated virus, as an unfortunate though well-meaning
fallacy of medical prejudice.

CHAPTER VII
<br />
<span  class="subhead">
RETURN TO ENGLAND
<br />
1869</span>
</h2>


<p>
In 1869 the early pioneer work in America was
ended. During the twenty years which followed the
graduation of the first woman physician, the public
recognition of the justice and advantage of such
a measure had steadily grown. Throughout the
Northern States the free and equal entrance of
women into the profession of medicine was secured.
In Boston, New York, and Philadelphia special
medical schools for women were sanctioned by the
Legislatures, and in some long-established colleges
women were received as students in the ordinary
classes.
</p>

<p>
Our New York centre was well organised under
able guidance, and I determined to return to England
for a temporary though prolonged residence, both to
renew physical strength, which had been severely
tried, and to enlarge my experience of life, as well
as to assist in the pioneer work so bravely commencing
in London, and which extended later to
Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
I soon found that social questions of vital importance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
to human progress were taking root in the
prepared soil of the older civilisation—questions
which were of absorbing interest. During the
following twenty years the responsibility of the
Christian physician assumed to me an ever-deepening
significance.
</p>

<p>
After a refreshing tour in the lovely Lake
District, arranged by my old friend Herman Bicknell,
we attended the Social Science Congress held
in Bristol in September of 1869. This was indeed a
noteworthy experience. I was the guest with Miss
Mary Carpenter of her relations Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas. One morning Miss Carpenter came into
my room with her hands full of papers, saying,
‘These papers refer to a subject that you must take
up. It is to be discussed at a sectional meeting
to-day, from which all women are excluded; but
you, as a doctor, have a right to be present, and will
be admitted, and you <i>must</i> attend.’
</p>

<p>
This formed my introduction to that tremendous
campaign against the unequal standard of sexual
morality known as the repeal of the ‘Contagious
Diseases Acts,’ in which for the following seventeen
years I was to take an active part, and which, from
its extended bearings, moulded the whole of my
future life.
</p>

<p>
The study of the papers thus brought to my
notice by Miss Carpenter was a revelation to me.
Perhaps happily for me, during my past life and
medical experiences I had never fully realised the
wide bearing of this subject and the inevitable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
social degradation produced by a double standard of
morality. My eyes were now suddenly opened,
never to be closed again, to that direful purchase of
women which is really the greatest obstacle to the
progress of the race.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant as I then was of the various aspects of
the Contagious Diseases Acts, I instantly perceived
their injustice, and at once accepted the difficult
mission Miss Carpenter laid upon me.
</p>

<p>
It was hoped by some members of the congress
that a resolution would be passed supporting the
one-sided Contagious Diseases Acts legislation,
against which a strong opposition was beginning
to arise, and I resolved that the voice of one member
of the congress, at any rate, should support the
foundation of morality—viz. equal justice. I therefore
attended the section, held at the Blind Asylum,
sitting far back in that assemblage of men.
</p>

<p>
I soon found, however, to my immense relief and
gratitude, that the cause of justice was in able and
vigorous male hands, led by Professor Francis Newman;
so I gladly withdrew from a painful position
in that sectional meeting, my advocacy not being
needed.
</p>

<p>
I was privileged at this time to make the acquaintance
of the Rev. Charles Kingsley and his
generous-hearted wife. On our first meeting, at an
evening party, Mr. Kingsley overwhelmed me by his
enthusiastic greeting. ‘You are one of my heroes,’
he said—a speech which I really could not then
understand; it seemed to stun me, in my quiet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
life. Later, as I learned to know his enthusiastic
character and profound social insight, I knew his
meaning. A sincere personal friendship was then
begun. He supported me by constant and wise
counsel until the time of his lamented death, which
was indeed a severe personal loss. I was warmly
welcomed to the Rectory of Eversley, and later to
the Deanery of Chester. On the pleasant and
historic pine hills of Bramshill, by the Eversley
Parsonage, and on the ancient walls of Chester, with
their noble outlook to the Welsh mountains, when
visiting the Deanery, I enjoyed memorable walks
with this generous-hearted man, when he threw
open his delightful stores of natural history and
strengthened me by his social wisdom.
</p>

<p>
An amusing personal experience at the Bristol
Congress was a ‘breakfast of all the religions,’
organised by my eccentric friend Herman Bicknell,
and at which he insisted that I should help him
preside. He said to me: ‘Holyoake is an Atheist,
Cowell Stepney a Materialist, Baunerjé and Chatterjé
are of the Hindoo Brahma Somaj, you are a
Christian, and I am a Catholic. It will be a most
remarkable gathering, and the discussion of such
varied opinions extremely interesting.’ I accepted
the queer invitation. The breakfast was held in a
large parlour of the hotel. We assembled at table,
and one of the first things the very deaf gentleman
on my right hand said to me was: ‘What an extraordinary,
odd notion that of a soul is! I wonder
how it could have arisen.’ But the most interesting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
remark by far was made by Holyoake, who, returning
from a secularist meeting of Bristol working
men, was at once accosted by our host: ‘Now,
Holyoake, pray let us have your famous demonstration
of the non-existence of a God.’ Mr. Holyoake
accepted the demand, and thought for some time in
a profound silence; then, with a puzzled face, he
suddenly burst out: ‘Upon my word, Bicknell, I
have really quite forgotten it!’
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingsley once said to me, pointing to Holyoake:
‘That man, many years ago, I put into prison
for blasphemy; now I am begging him to come
down and visit me at Eversley!’ Our breakfast of
all the religions as an active contest was a failure.
The hostile forces met together, but, instead of
fighting, they fraternised!
</p>

<p>
It was during this visit to Bristol in 1869 that
the curious experience, already referred to on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>,
occurred, when I visited the house where my early
childhood was spent.
</p>

<p>
On settling in London as a physician, I resided
for some time with my valued friend Barbara Leigh
Smith, then Madame Bodichon, at whose house in
Blandford Square I met her wide and varied circle
of literary and artistic friends and many leaders of
social reform. Herbert Spencer, Dante Rossetti,
Mrs. Lewes, the Peter Taylors, Mrs. Crawshay, Miss
Goldsmid, Miss Cobbe, and Keshub Chunder Sen
represent a few of the persons I was privileged to
meet.
</p>

<p>
At this time I had engaged medical consultation-rooms
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
in an apparently respectable house in York
Place, on the front door of which the house agent
allowed me to place my name. I soon found, however,
that my doctor’s sign was intended to conceal
the dubious character of the occupier of the house,
and I had unconsciously walked into a trap! But
friends came to the rescue and compelled the cancelling
of the lease with which I was entangled. I
then established myself at No. 6 Burwood Place,
where the commencement of a promising medical
practice was soon formed.
</p>

<p>
I eagerly entered upon the varied and intensely
interesting social life now opened to me.
</p>

<p>
My long-cherished conviction of the supreme
importance of the medical profession as the great
conservator of health constantly deepened.
</p>

<p>
In 1870, being invited to address the Working
Women’s College, I took as the subject of my discourse
‘How to Keep a Household in Health.’ This lecture
laid down rules of health for the guidance of poor
women in the management of their households, and
was welcomed by the audience. One person present,
however, sent a slanderous account of this lecture to
the ‘Pall Mall Gazette,’ and I was overwhelmed by
the receipt of anonymous letters, and letters from
persons in all classes of society, requesting medical
advice on the most important and delicate subjects—subjects
which are only suitable for the confidential
counsel of the physician’s consulting-room, where
alone advice adapted to each individual case can be
judiciously given. I mentioned this experience of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
the newspaper attack and the subsequent correspondence
to my friend Mr. Kingsley. He exclaimed: ‘Oh,
you did not answer those letters, I trust?’ I assured
him that I had always refused to give the advice asked
for by letter, and had invariably returned fees when
enclosed. ‘Thank God for that!’ he exclaimed with
an energy that amazed me; and he then related to me
a very painful experience of his own, saying: ‘Let me
warn you, never answer a newspaper attack. There
are some newspapers that delight in getting hold of
a scandal or whatever may make their paper sell, and
are utterly unscrupulous as to the means by which
such a purpose is accomplished. You have no chance
against such corrupt speculation; your only weapon
is silence and your own established character.’
</p>

<p>
On February 19, 1871, under the auspices of the
Sunday Lecture Society, I gave an address, ‘On the
Religion of Health,’ to a large appreciative audience
in St. George’s Hall. The same year a small
meeting was held in the drawing-room of 6 Burwood
Place, to consider the important subject of a steady
and wide diffusion of sanitary knowledge among all
the people. There ‘The National Health Society’
was formed, for which Mr. Prout Newcombe (who
was present) shaped the stamp of the society,
with its motto, ‘Prevention is better than cure.’
This society, which established its first office in
Berners Street under the intelligent secretaryship of
Miss Toulmin Smith, continues its enlarging sphere
of usefulness under the able management of Miss
Fay Lankester.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At this time the medical dispensary established
by Miss Garrett for women and children in Seymour
Place was growing and enlisting a large number of
influential friends.
</p>

<p>
From this small beginning has grown the New
Hospital and London School of Medicine for Women,
connected with the Royal Free Hospital. This is
not the place to speak of the intelligent and persevering
efforts to which those institutions owe their
origin. The work of Dr. Garrett Anderson and
Dr. Sophia Jex Blake will always be remembered.
It was my privilege and pleasure in some small
degree to encourage these brave workers in their
pioneer enterprise in England.
</p>

<p>
Whilst attending to an increasing medical practice,
a visit from Mr. William Pare, who had written
an interesting account of the Ralahine land experiment
in Ireland, which proved so successful under the
management of Mr. E. T. Craig, drew my attention to
the important co-operative movement steadily growing
in England.<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> The abortive attempts at co-operative
society which I had watched in the United States,
at Brook Farm, Red Bank, Eagleswood, and other
places, in no way shook the faith that through failure
and renewed effort the true principles of a wise
organisation of human relations would gradually be
evolved. The English co-operative movement was
characteristic of the common-sense, unambitious way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
in which reforms grow in England. The religious
element introduced by such a noble band of Christian
Socialists as Maurice, Kingsley, Hughes, and Ludlow
gave a hopefulness to this movement which no
attempts based on a limited view of material well-being
can afford.
</p>

<p>
Medical experience was daily showing the influence
of the mind over the body, and I eagerly
longed to see an embodiment of Christian principles
in society, which embodiment was, as yet, far from
attainment.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of this investigation, at the end of
August 1872 I determined to visit the Familistère
of Guise, formed by Godin Lemaire. His book,
‘Solutions Sociales,’ describing the growth of the institution,
was exceedingly interesting, and contained
valuable suggestions for future workers, and I wished
to see its practical working for myself. At the end
of a fatiguing journey to Guise, on the Belgian
frontier of France, for at that time many miles had
to be traversed by diligence, I was cordially welcomed
by M. Lemaire, and spent several very interesting
days in the great Familistère, observing the life
there.
</p>

<p>
The Familistère, which accommodated several
hundred people, was erected on a tract of land
almost encircled by the river, which tract was laid
out in gardens and pleasure grounds. Across the
river stood the large factories and workshops for the
manufacture of stoves, &amp;c., which furnished the
remunerative occupation of the little community.
</p>

<p>
I attended the prize-giving at the schools, saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
the theatre, workmen’s club and choral society,
witnessed a ball, and visited the manufactory. The
organisation was a great object-lesson both in its
success and its defects; full of interest to those who
seriously study this important subject of improved
social relations. The life at the Familistère, however,
was intense, and rather overpowering to me.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after my return I was attacked by illness,
which proved so serious in its effects that in 1873
the Burwood Place establishment was broken up,
and my plan of life necessarily changed. During the
next three years I vainly endeavoured to resume my
London work, but was frequently obliged to seek
health in change of residence and foreign travel.
This travel included a memorable winter in Rome,
which need not be further referred to, although the
approach to the Eternal City—when, across the
Campagna, the dome of St. Peter’s was first visible—was
a thrilling personal joy, never to be forgotten.
But my purely personal experiences will not be
dwelt on.
</p>

<p>
When the London School of Medicine for Women
was established I hastened my return, and accepted
the Chair of Gynæcology in the college.
</p>

<p>
In my lodgings in Dorset Square I again suffered
from atrocious biliary colic, which the able physicians
whom I consulted were unable to relieve, finished my
course of lectures with extreme difficulty, and came
to the conclusion, with bitter disappointment, that
any future residence in London under my circumstances
must be given up.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The winters of 1876-78 were spent chiefly at
Bordighera and in Nice. An episode there is worth
recording.
</p>

<p>
My enlarging experience in various countries in
respect to the relations between men and women—the
customs, the diseases, the social disaster springing
from errors as to human physiology and neglect
in education with regard to the most important
functions—showed me the imperative work which
devolved upon the physician in this matter. I
realised that the mind cannot be separated from the
body in any profound view of the scope of medical
responsibility. Under the olive trees of Bordighera,
and sitting by its lovely blue sea, I meditated on the
duty of the physician, and finally wrote the small
work, ‘Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education
of their Children.’
</p>

<p>
So little at that time was the importance of sexual
education understood, and the necessity of its consideration
accepted, that when I read my manuscript
to a warm and enlightened English friend staying
at Mentone, she assured me that if I published that
manuscript my ‘name would be a forbidden word in
England.’
</p>

<p>
I sent the manuscript, however, to about twelve
of the leading London publishers, who all declined
the publication. I therefore printed a small edition
myself, which a bookseller consented to keep on sale.
A copy of this little book fell under the notice of
Miss Ellice Hopkins, who, considering that it would be
useful in the special work in which she was engaged,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
induced Mr. Hudson, the then acting member of the
firm of Hatchard &amp; Co., to reconsider the matter and
publish the book for her use. The arrangement was
made and the book printed; but soon after I received
a letter saying that though the firm had
never yet broken faith with an author, yet they
feared they must do so now; for the senior member
of the firm, Bishop Hatchard’s widow, had seen the
proof of the book, thrown it into the fire, and desired
that its publication should be stopped!
</p>

<p>
Finally, a little consultation of elderly clergymen
was called to consider the subject, and it was at
last resolved that if the name of the work could be
changed, and the distinct announcement made in
the title that it was a medical as well as a moral
work, the publication might be continued. Of course
the change was made, and ‘Counsel to Parents’
became ‘The Moral Education of the Young, considered
under <i>Medical</i> and Social Aspects.’
</p>

<p>
I mention this curious experience as an encouragement
to those who are engaged in all branches
of moral work. Public sentiment has advanced since
1876. Looking now at the very reticent way in
which the subject is treated in this little book, it is
difficult to believe that such an episode could have
occurred.
</p>

<p>
It has become clear to me that our medical profession
has not yet fully realised the special and
weighty responsibility which rests upon it to watch
over the cradle of the race; to see that human beings
are well born, well nourished, and well educated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
The onward impulse to this great work would seem
to be especially incumbent upon women physicians,
who for the first time are beginning to realise the
all-important character of parentage in its influence
upon the adult as well as on the child—i.e. on the
race.
</p>

<p>
To every woman, as well as to every man, the
responsible function of parentage is delegated. Our
nature is dwarfed or degraded if the growth
which should be attained by the exercise of parentage,
directly or potentially, be either avoided or
perverted.
</p>

<p>
The physician knows that the natural family
group is the first essential element of a progressive
society. The degeneration of that element by the
degradation of either of its two essential factors, the
man or the woman, begins the ruin of a State.
</p>

<p>
It is a source of deep gratitude in a long medical
life to have been enabled by physiological knowledge,
as well as experience, to perceive the true point of
view from which the special nature of man and
woman must be regarded. It is well worth the
efforts of a lifetime to have attained knowledge
which justifies an attack on the root of all evil—viz.
the deadly atheism which asserts that because forms
of evil have always existed in society, therefore they
must always exist; and that the attainment of a
high ideal is a hopeless chimera.
</p>

<p>
The study of human nature by women as well
as men commences that new and hopeful era of
the intelligent co-operation of the sexes through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
which alone real progress can be attained and
secured. We may look forward with hope to the
future influence of Christian women physicians,
when with sympathy and reverence guiding intellectual
activity they learn to apply the vital principles
of their Great Master to every method and
practice of the healing art.

<p>
The following letter, lately published in the New York
‘Church Union’ by a well-known physician of New
York, is interesting as the testimony of a gentleman who
was a fellow-student in the Geneva Medical College.
</p>


<p class="center p2">
<b><i>The Medical Co-education of the Sexes. By</i> <span class="smcap">Stephen
Smith</span>, M.D.</b>
</p>

<p>
Medical circles were recently entertained by a symposium
of prominent physicians discussing the propriety
of the medical co-education of the sexes. All of the
writers were opposed to the suggestion; some, notably
Dr. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, expressed the utmost
disgust at the proposition. It happened to me to have
witnessed the first instance of the co-education of medical
students of both sexes in this country, and the results
quite upset the theories of these gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
The first course of medical lectures which I attended
was in a medical college in the interior of this State
in 1847-48. The class, numbering about 150 students,
was composed largely of young men from the neighbouring
towns. They were rude, boisterous, and riotous
beyond comparison. On several occasions the residents
of the neighbourhood sent written protests to the faculty,
threatening to have the college indicted as a nuisance if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
the disturbance did not cease. During lectures it was
often almost impossible to hear the professors, owing to
the confusion.
</p>

<p>
Some weeks after the course began the dean appeared
before the class with a letter in his hand, which
he craved the indulgence of the students to be allowed to
read. Anticipation was extreme when he announced that
it contained the most extraordinary request which had
ever been made to the faculty. The letter was written
by a physician of Philadelphia, who requested the faculty
to admit as a student a lady who was studying medicine
in his office. He stated that she had been refused admission
by several medical colleges, but, as this institution
was in the country, he thought it more likely to be
free from prejudice against a woman medical student.
The dean stated that the faculty had taken action on the
communication, and directed him to report their conclusion
to the class. The faculty decided to leave the matter
in the hands of the class, with this understanding—that
if any single student objected to her admission, a negative
reply would be returned. It subsequently appeared that
the faculty did not intend to admit her, but wished to
escape direct refusal by referring the question to the
class, with a proviso which, it was believed, would necessarily
exclude her.
</p>

<p>
But the whole affair assumed the most ludicrous
aspect to the class, and the announcement was received
with the most uproarious demonstrations of favour. A
meeting was called for the evening, which was attended
by every member. The resolution approving the admission
of the lady was sustained by a number of the most
extravagant speeches, which were enthusiastically cheered.
The vote was finally taken, with what seemed to be one
unanimous yell, ‘Yea!’ When the negative vote was
called, a single voice was heard uttering a timid ‘No.’
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
The scene that followed passes description. A general
rush was made for the corner of the room which emitted
the voice, and the recalcitrant member was only too glad
to acknowledge his error and record his vote in the
affirmative. The faculty received the decision of the
class with evident disfavour, and returned an answer
admitting the lady student. Two weeks or more elapsed,
and as the lady student did not appear, the incident of
her application was quite forgotten, and the class continued
in its riotous career. One morning, all unexpectedly,
a lady entered the lecture-room with the
professor; she was quite small of stature, plainly dressed,
appeared diffident and retiring, but had a firm and determined
expression of face. Her entrance into that Bedlam
of confusion acted like magic upon every student. Each
hurriedly sought his seat, and the most absolute silence
prevailed. For the first time a lecture was given without
the slightest interruption, and every word could be heard
as distinctly as it would if there had been but a single
person in the room. The sudden transformation of this
class from a band of lawless desperadoes to gentlemen,
by the mere presence of a lady, proved to be permanent
in its effects. A more orderly class of medical students
was never seen than this, and it continued to be to the
close of the term.
</p>

<p>
The real test of the influence of a woman upon the
conduct and character of a man in co-education was
developed when the Professor of Anatomy came to that
part of his course which required demonstrations that
he believed should be witnessed only by men. The professor
was a rollicking, jovial man, who constantly interspersed
his lectures with witty remarks and funny anecdotes.
Nor did he study to have his language chaste, or
the moral of his stories pure and elevating. In fact,
vulgarity and profanity formed a large part of his ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
lectures; and especially was this true of the lectures on
the branch of anatomy above mentioned. On this
account, chiefly, he was exceedingly popular with his
class; and during his lectures stamping, clapping, and
cheering were the principal employments of the students.
</p>

<p>
One morning our lady student was missed at the
lecture on anatomy, and the professor entered the room
evidently labouring under great excitement. He stated
that he had a communication to make to the class which
demanded the most serious consideration. He then
explained that he had thought it highly improper that
the lady student should attend certain lectures specially
adapted for men, and as he was approaching that
subject he had frankly advised her to absent herself, in a
letter which he read. He dwelt upon the indelicacy of
the subject, the embarrassment under which he should
labour if a lady were present, and the injustice which
would be done to the class by the imperfect manner in
which he should be obliged to demonstrate the subject.
He closed by offering her abundant private opportunities
for study and dissection. He then read her reply. It
was gracefully written, and showed a full appreciation of
his embarrassing position, when viewed from the low
standpoint of impure and unchaste sentiments. But she
could not conceive of a medical man whose mind was
not so elevated and purified by the study of the science
of anatomy that such sentiments would for a moment
influence him. Coming to the practical question of her
attendance upon these lectures, she stated that if the
professor would really be embarrassed by the presence of
a lady on the first tier of seats, she would take her seat
on the upper tier; and she trusted that his interest in his
subject would lead him to entirely forget the presence of
student No. 130—her registered number. At the close
of the letter the professor acknowledged the justice of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
rebuke which he had received, and declared that a lady
who was animated by such elevated views of her profession
was entitled to every possible encouragement which
the class or faculty could give. He then opened the
door and she entered, only to receive an ovation of the
most overwhelming character. The lectures on anatomy
proceeded in regular order to their conclusion; and it
was the universal testimony of the oldest students that
they had never listened to such a complete and thorough
course.
</p>

<p>
At the close of the term our lady student came up
for examination for graduation, and took rank with the
best students of the class. As this was the first instance
of the granting of a medical diploma to a woman in this
country, so far as the faculty had information, there was
at first some hesitation about conferring the degree.
But it was finally determined to take the novel step, and
in the honour list of the roll of graduates for that year
appears the name, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.

<i>First Annual Report of the New York Dispensary for
Poor Women and Children, 1855</i>
</h3>
<p>
The design of this institution is to give to poor women
an opportunity of consulting physicians of their own sex.
The existing charities of our city regard the employment
of women as physicians as an experiment, the success of
which has not yet been sufficiently proved to admit
of cordial co-operation. It was therefore necessary to
form a separate institution which should furnish to poor
women the medical aid which they could not obtain elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The following gentlemen cordially consented to act as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
trustees of the proposed institution: Messrs. Butler,
White, Haydock, Sedgwick, Collins, Field, Draper,
Greeley, West, Harris, Foster, Raymond, Flanders, Dana,
Manning, Spring, Bowne. Consulting physicians, Drs.
Kissam, Parker, Cammann, Taylor. Attending physician,
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.
</p>

<p>
Messrs. Sedgwick and Butler kindly procured an Act
of Incorporation. A meeting for organisation was held
on January 30, 1854. A constitution and bylaws were
adopted, and the following members were appointed an
Executive Committee to transact the business for the
year: Stacy B. Collins, Richard H. Bowne, Charles A.
Dana, Elizabeth Blackwell, Charles Foster.
</p>

<p>
The Eleventh Ward was chosen as the location for
the dispensary, it being destitute of medical charity,
while possessing a densely crowded poor population.
The necessary rooms were found in Seventh Street, near
Tompkins Square, and were ready for the reception of
patients in the month of March. The dispensary has
been regularly opened through the year, on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, at 3 o’clock. Over
200 poor women have received medical aid. All
these women have gratefully acknowledged the help
afforded them, and several of the most destitute have
tendered their few pence as an offering to the institution.
</p>

<p>
With all these patients, the necessity of cleanliness,
ventilation, and judicious diet has been strongly urged,
and in many cases the advice has been followed, at any
rate for a time. A word of counsel or information, too,
has often been given to the destitute widow or friendless
girl who was seeking work as well as health; the best
methods of seeking employment have been pointed out,
suitable charities occasionally recommended, and pecuniary
aid sometimes rendered.
</p>

<p>
Since the double distress of commercial pressure and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
severe weather have weighed so heavily on the poor,
many cases of extreme destitution have come to the
dispensary. These have been chiefly emigrants, mostly
Germans, without friends or money, and ignorant of the
language. Several families have been visited where some
member was sick, and found utterly destitute, suffering
from hunger, and though honest and industrious, disappointed
in every effort to obtain work. To such families
a little help with money, generally in the form of a loan
till work could be procured, has proved invaluable, and a
small poor fund placed by some friends in the hands of
the attending physician, for this special object, has saved
several worthy families from despair and impending
starvation.
</p>

<p>
The dispensary has been removed since January 1,
1855, to No. 150 Third Street, between Avenues A and B,
opposite the large Catholic church; all persons who are
interested in its objects are cordially invited to call there.
It will be open as heretofore from 3 to 5 o’clock on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons. Poor
women and children may be sent from any part of the
city to receive the medical aid of the dispensary, it being
free to all.
</p>

<p>
This institution was commenced by the subscriptions
of a few friends; its expenses have been kept within its
means, but the power of doing good has necessarily been
limited by the smallness of its funds. It is found desirable
to enlarge its operations, and place it on a permanent
basis. For this purpose, the trustees wish to raise the
sum of 5,000 dollars, and contributions are earnestly
solicited. The following members are appointed to receive
contributions:
</p>


<ul class="none">
<li class="nospace">Stacy B. Collins, 155 Bleecker Street,</li>
<li class="nospace">Robert Haydock, 46 Broadway,</li>
<li class="nospace">Elizabeth Blackwell, 79 East Fifteenth Street.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The amount raised will be invested as a permanent
fund for the institution. It is the hope of the founders of
this charity to make it eventually a hospital for women
and a school for the education of nurses.
</p>

<p>
The books of the dispensary are always open to the
inspection of members, on application to the attending
physician.

‘A very notable event of the year 1848 was the appearance at the
medical lectures of a young woman student named Blackwell. She
is a pretty little specimen of the feminine gender, said the Boston
<i>Medical Journal</i>, reporting her age at twenty-six. She comes into
the class with great composure, takes off her bonnet and puts it
under the seat, exposing a fine phrenology. The effect on the class
has been good, and great decorum is observed while she is present.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_6'>[6]</a></span> I was at that time utterly unaware of the amount of degrading
cruelty perpetrated by many foreign investigators upon helpless
animals under methods erroneously called scientific. It required the
extended observation of the physician to realise the intellectual
fallacy necessarily involved in experiments which destroy the thing
to be observed; and also to recognise how the constant promulgation
of false theory and practice arising from erroneous methods of
investigation hinders the attainment of scientific medicine.
</p>

<p class='footnote'>
I have long since realised that conscience and humanity must
guide intellectual activity and curiosity, or we wander from the high-road
of truth into a labyrinth of error. The above experience illustrates
how the eager young student, thirsting for knowledge, may be
blind to the unscientific or immoral methods of pseudo-science.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
